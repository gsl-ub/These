            The determination of polyphenols in wines is of great interest in the field of food analysis due to health and organoleptic implications. In addition, the applicability of polyphenols as food descriptors to be used for characterization, classification, and authentication purposes is gaining popularity. In this work, a simple and reliable method based on {HPLC} separation in reversed-phase mode with {UV}-Vis detection was developed and applied to determine polyphenolic compounds in white wines. The chromatographic separation was performed using {aC}18 column under a methanol elution gradient and assessed by an experimental design approach. Analytical parameters were established under the optimal experimental conditions. {LOD} values were between 3 and 220 µg/L, and repeatability values were better than 1\% for most of the analyzed polyphenols. Compositional data were further exploited to characterize white wines based on principal component analysis to discriminate among mono- and polyvarietal compositions.},

The market could benefit significantly if a simple and cheap method of analyzing a wine’s aromatic profile were developed. The purpose of this study is to develop such a method. A multi-analytical method for quantifying 39 volatile compounds of wine aroma was developed and validated using liquid–liquid extraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}/{MS}). The method was validated for its linearity, reproducibility, recovery, limit of detection, and limit of quantification and showed excellent results for almost all compounds. The method was applied to 25 commercial Protected Designation of Origin “Nemea” wines, and the results were compared and correlated with the sensory analysis results by a trained panel. The correlations among the parameters indicated that the newly developed {GC}-{MS}/{MS} method produces similar results to human responses.},

In the present study we have shown that classification models can be improved when 1H {NMR} profiles are fused with stable isotope ({SNIF}-{NMR}, 18O, 13C) data. Variable selection based on clustering of latent variables was performed on 1H {NMR} data. Afterwards, the combined data of 718 wine samples from Germany were analyzed using linear discriminant analysis ({LDA}), partial least squares-discriminant analysis ({PLS}-{DA}), factorial discriminant analysis ({FDA}) and independent components analysis ({ICA}). Moreover, several specialized multiblock methods (common components and specific weights analysis ({ComDim}), consensus {PCA} and consensus {PLS}-{DA}) were applied to the data. The best improvement in comparison with 1H {NMR} data was obtained for prediction of the geographical origin (up to 100\% for the fused data, whereas stable isotope data resulted only in 60–70\% correct prediction and 1H {NMR} data alone in 82–89\% respectively). Certain enhancement was obtained also for the year of vintage (from 88 to 97\% for 1H {NMR} to 99\% for the fused data), whereas in case of grape varieties improved models were not obtained. The combination of 1H {NMR} data with stable isotope data improves efficiency of classification models for geographical origin and vintage of wine and can be potentially used for other food products as well.},

A total of about 600 wines were selected and carefully collected from ﬁve wine-growing areas in the southern and southwestern parts of Germany. Simultaneous saturation of the resonances of water and ethanol by application of a low-power eight-frequency band irradiation using shaped pulses allowed for high receiver gain settings and hence optimized signal-to-noise ratios. Correct prediction of classiﬁcation of the grape varieties of Pinot noir, Lemberger, Pinot blanc/Pinot gris, Müller-Thurgau, Riesling, and Gewürztraminer of 95\% in the wine panel was achieved. The classiﬁcation of the vintage of all analyzed wines resulted in correct predictions of 97 and 96\%, respectively, for vintage 2008 (n = 318) and 2009 (n = 265). The geographic origin of all wines from the largest German wineproducing regions, Rheinpfalz, Rheinhessen, Mosel, Baden, and Württemberg, could be predicted 89\% correctly on average.

              Several organic acids such as malic, tartaric and citric acids are key grape and wine constituents. They greatly contribute to the organoleptic properties of grapes and wines and are responsible for their acidity, a crucial wine property that is known to considerably vary as a function of grape variety, environmental conditions and viticulture, as well as during wine maturation. A rapid and simple method, requiring minimum sample pre-treatment and no chromatographic separation, based on direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ({ESI}-{MS}) was developed and validated to quantitate organic acids in wines and grapes. This method was also demonstrated to be able to monitor a common wine adulteration procedure, that is, addition of citric acid for {pH} adjustment. {ESI}-{MS} data when treated

This showed the evolution of the volatile compounds based on the chemical and mechanical processes involved in the specific vinification phase.

	abstract = {Wine is one of the most popular alcoholic beverages. Therefore, the control of the elemental composition is necessary throughout the entire production process from the grapes to the final product. The content of some elements in wine is very important from the organoleptic and nutritional points of view. Nowadays, wine studies have also been undertaken in order to perform wine categorization and/or to verify the authenticity of products. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of the chosen factors (type of wine, producer, origin) on the levels of 28 elements in 180 wine samples. The concentration of studied elements was determined by {ICP}-{MS} (Ag, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sn, Sr, Te, Tl, U, Zn), {ICP}-{OES} (Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Ti), and {CVAAS} (Hg) techniques in 79 red, 75 white, and 26 rose wine samples. In general, red wines contained higher values of mean and median of B, Ba, Cr, Cu, Mn, Sr and Zn in contrast to other wine types (white and rose). In white wines (when compared to red and rose wines) higher levels of elements such as Ag, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Li, K and Ti were determined. In contrast, rose wines were characterized by a higher concentration of Fe and U. The study also revealed that in the case of 18 samples, the maximum levels of some metals (Cd—8 samples, Pb—9 samples, Cu—1 sample) were slightly exceeded according to the {OIV} standards, while for Zn and Ti in any wine sample the measured concentrations of these metals were above the permissible levels. Thus, it can be stated that the studied wines contained, in general, lower levels of heavy metals, suggesting that they should have no effect on the safety of consumption. The results also showed higher {pH} level for red wines as a consequence of the second fermentation process which is typically carried out for this type of wine (malolactic fermentation). The highest median value of {pH} was reported for Merlot-based wines, while the lowest was for Riesling. It is assumed that dry Riesling has a higher content of tartaric and malic acid than dry Chardonnay grown in the same climate. From all of the studied countries, wines from Poland seemed to present one of the most characteristic elemental fingerprints since for many elements relatively low levels were recorded. Moreover, this study revealed that also wine samples from {USA} and Australia can be potentially discriminated from the rest of studied wines. For {USA} the most characteristic metal for positive identification of the country of origin seems to be uranium, whereases for Australia – strontium and manganese. Based on the highly reduced set of samples, it was not possible to differentiate the studied wine products according to the grape variety other than Syrah, and partially Chardonnay. Since all the Syrah-based samples originated from the same country (Australia) thus, the observed grouping should be more related with the country of origin than the grape variety.},

 wine by gasbench isotopic ratio mass spectroscopy and cavity ring down infrared spectroscopy, respectively. When the difference between ?13CCO2 and ?13CDRW is negative, the presence of artificial {CO}2 can be undoubtedly

These techniques have accomplished numerous purposes, since the management of soil practices to the analysis of bottled wine, with different levels of success.

	abstract = {We propose a {QCM}-{DNA} biosensor for single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) detection in samples of differing complexity. An optimized protocol is presented, focusing on parameters affecting probe immobilization and hybridization efficiency. Our results led to the implementation of thiolated probe reduction with {TCEP}, followed by immobilization in {PBS} buffer containing {MgCl}2. The biosensor exhibited an enhanced specificity at 37 ◦C, achieving detection of single mismatches using synthetic targets. Using real samples, we applied the biosensor in a wine authenticity assessment context. The addition of dithiothreitol improved stability and reproducibility when testing wine {DNA} samples. The {QCM}-{DNA} biosensor was able to specifically detect complementary {DNA} in leaf and wine {DNA} samples, distinguishing between samples with two heterozygous mismatches. The biosensor solely depends on {DNA} extraction, basic instrumentation, and reagents, without requiring {PCR} or signal amplification strategies. Our findings show the biosensor potential for applications in wine authenticity assessment and other fields requiring complex analysis in undemanding settings.},

	abstract = {Aim: This study characterises and identifies 79 grapevine accessions from the Canary Islands and 14 from Madeira using simple sequence repeat ({SSR}) analysis.Methods and Results: A kit of 20 microsatellites or simple sequence repeats ({SSRs}) were used to obtain the molecular profiles of the 93 accessions in this study. The results allowed us to identify four new cultivars (Bienmesabe tinto, Burra volcanica, Vallera, Verijadiego negro), two new colour mutations (Listan rosa, Mollar cano rosado) and two unknown molecular profiles from Madeira. Furthermore, we propose that eight names of varieties be included in the Vitis International Variety Catalogue ({VIVC}) as prime names, and 38 accession names as synonyms, 19 of which are regarded as new synonyms of the 12 varieties. Finally, we also reported eight cases of mislabelling. The study of genetic structure shows that the cultivars from the Canary Islands and Madeira are strongly influenced by the Iberian Peninsula. We propose that 14 varieties and three sports (mutations) at are local to the Canary Islands: Albillo criollo, Bermejuela, Bienmesabe tinto, Burra volcanica, Albillo forastero, Huevo de gallo, Listan negro, Listan rosa, Malvasia di Sardegna rosada, Malvasia volcanica, Mollar cano rosado, Torrontes volcanico, Sabro, Uva de año, Vallera, Verijadiego, and Verijadiego negro.Conclusions: It has been reliably shown that these cultivars have a characteristic genome: phylloxera never reached the Canary Islands so mutations, hybridations and human selection have been able to accumulate over 500 years. It is of great importance that this local plant material be conserved, given that it is part of our vine heritage. In the case of Madeira, it has not been possible to propose any local varieties because phylloxera did reach the island; this devastated the vineyards and there was a drastic reduction in local varieties. However, one unknown cultivar was the most characteristic genotype from this region.Significance and impact of the study: This study shows the existence of non well-known varieties of Vitis vinifera L. that may be used to elaborate original wines, offering therefore new organoleptic sensations for the consumers. Furthermore, these results suggest that this volcanic area could be considered as one centre of origin of new cultivars of Vitis vinifera L. (Biodiversity Centre).},

Investigations were carried out to quantify eugenol in the wines used for distillation, in the musts and finally in several parts of the plant. For all matrices over both vintages, it was confirmed that eugenol is much more abundant in Baco blanc than in Ugni blanc and Folle blanche. Moreover, enzymatic hydrolysis made it possible to release a significant quantity of eugenol from precursors, demonstrating that more than 90\% of eugenol is bound in the must and in the grape berry pulp.},

Previous studies have assumed this convention of coloraroma matching, and have investigated color’s influence on the perception of aroma only in dyed white wine or in red wine from particular places of origin. Here the aromas of 48 white and red varietal wines from around the world were evaluated in black glasses then in clear glasses by a panel of wine experts. As wine color was made visible, ratings for green fruit, citrus fruit, and stone fruit generally decreased among the red wines and increased among the white wines, while the opposite occurred for red fruit, dark fruit, and oak. The dependence of these aroma descriptors on visual input suggests their usage is more cognitive than perceptual. The influence of color was indirectly evident even in black glasses: three oaked Chardonnays were rated highly in red fruit and dark fruit, relative to the unoaked white wines, suggesting the judges here associated oak with red wine and consequently used oakiness to deduce wine color before rating the aromas believed to be appropriate. Findings suggest color-driven descriptors, used when wine color can be seen or surmised, do not foster objective assessments of wine aroma.},

Phenolic compounds and volatile aromatic substances passed from the wood to the wine improving the aroma and taste and enhancing its antioxidant activity. Their quantity has depended on the botanical type and origin of the wood and the method of its heat treatment. In the production of white wines several technologies have been applied - conducting the alcoholic fermentation and aging on lees in barrels, completing the fermentation in tanks and racking the wine to the barrels, starting the fermentation in tanks but in the middle of the process racking the fermenting juice to the barrels. Into the wine, of phenols mainly passed gallotannins and ellagitannins and of aromatic substances – eugenol, isoeugenol, vanillin, furan derivatives, lactones, etc. Further to the use of barrels, the application of alternative oak forms has become more and more popular, which in the case of white wines allowed avoiding the volatile components oxidation. The result was a quality product with better technological properties. The wines acquired hints of wood without losing their freshness and fruity character.},

	abstract = {Wine encapsulates the expression of multiple inputs – from the vineyard location and environment to viticultural and winemaking practices – collectively known as terroir. Each of these inputs inﬂuence a wine’s chemical composition and sensory traits, which vary depending on cultivar as well as provenance. These aspects underpin the overall concept of wine typicity, an important notion that enables wine from a delimited geographical area to be differentiated and recognisable in national and international wine markets. Indeed, consumers are increasingly more aware of the signiﬁcance of regionality and may use this to inﬂuence their purchasing decisions. Understanding which sensory attributes represent regional typicity and how these are best conveyed to consumers is therefore important for the prosperity and reputation of producers. As reviewed herein, the sensory typicity of wine can be identiﬁed using different types of testing methods, with the most effective being a combination of approaches, such as sorting task in combination with descriptive sensory analysis. Consumer perceptions of regionality and wine typicity are then examined to provide insight into their behaviours. This includes consideration of the importance of origin to perceptions of quality and typicity, in terms of meeting expectations and engaging consumers. Based on the literature reviewed, it is proposed that wine typicity can be deﬁned as a juxtaposition of unique traits that deﬁne a class of wines having common aspects of terroir involving biophysical and human dimensions that make the wines recognisable, and in theory, unable to be replicated in another territory.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: The use of minerality as a wine descriptor has increased in the last few years. Minerality always suggests high quality and evokes a link between wine and the soil. The sensory meaning of minerality, however, is not yet clearly understood. The present study was designed to understand how wine experts conceptualise minerality and to explore whether they can judge wine minerality in a consensual way.
Methods and Results: Experts carried out an orthonasal free sorting task on 16 Chardonnay wines. Afterwards, they rated their mineral character according to two conditions: orthonasally and on the palate while wearing a nose-clip. The experts also answered a questionnaire in which they deﬁned minerality. A trained panel independently performed a sensory description of the samples. The wine experts showed strong disagreement in their minerality judgements under both conditions. Three groups of experts emerged for each condition. Each group considered as mineral wines with quite different sensory characteristics which prevents any generalisation concerning the sensory meaning of minerality. Surprisingly, deﬁnitions of minerality by the experts showed some commonality despite the use of idiosyncratic terms.
Conclusions: Minerality is an ill-deﬁned sensory concept, despite the apparent consistency emerging from verbal deﬁnitions by the experts. Signiﬁcance of the Study: Minerality is nowadays a popular term in wine marketing. Some attempts to understand its chemical origin have been made; however, this study has shown that a sensory deﬁnition of minerality should ﬁrst be developed.},

Producers of {PDO} food products and wines have to present {EU} authorities a technical speciﬁcation of their product, which includes its sensory description. European regulation 1151/12 establishes that sensory characteristics included in {PDO} certiﬁcation must be guaranteed. Nevertheless, there is no standardized approach for the development of sensory control methods for {PDO} food products, so each entity in charge of controlling the characteristics of the {PDO} products decides the best way to follow this legal requirement. This paper presents the current situation in Spain, Italy and France in relation to the ofﬁcial sensory control of {PDO} food products and wines and the accreditation of the laboratories for this control (these three countries represent 68.9\% of the total {PDO} products registered in the {EU}). This manuscript also shows the main methodologies applied in the ofﬁcial sensory control of {PDO} food products and wines. The wide diversity of methods used for the sensory control and associated panel management among {PDOs} manifests the need to harmonize technical criteria and references at European level. This is also urgent, because broad differences in the approaches and requirements for sensory control could bring about unfair competition among {PDOs}. In this sense, European Sensory Science Society (E3S) has become an {EA} recognized stakeholder collaborating in a framework in order to prepare a document for the harmonization of methodological approaches and technical criteria for the sensory control of {PDO} food products and wines.},

The aim is to test if the area of origin has a significant impact on the grade after controlling for essential variables highlighted by the literature like 1855 ranking and climate. The preliminary results clearly indicate the prominence of the appellation in the grade explanation. We show that the determinants of ratings vary among experts and that some of them over-grade some wines produced in specific areas, revealing their own tastes. Following a series of coefficient equality tests we conclude that: - The all 3 {US} experts exhibit an obvious preference for right bank wines and {PessacLéognan}. - At the opposite, Jancis Robinson ({UK}) prefers the left bank wines (Médoc area). - J.-M. Quarin (France) doesn’t reveal any clear preferences for a given area in the Bordeaux vineyard. This first correlation analysis has to be extended with a ranking analysis as proposed by Quandt (2012). This part of the work is still in progress at this time. But the previous conclusion is in accordance with the classic statement of Parker impact on the right bank. The growing phenomena of “garage” wine in Saint-Emilion and Pomerol in the last decade is seen has a consequence of the Parker taste influence on the winemaking process (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garagistes).},

	abstract = {Metrological reliability in the sensory evaluation of products is of fundamental importance in ensuring the comparability of results. The issue of uncertainties regarding measured data in such contexts has led to new scientific approaches in the field of sensory analysis, which have become fundamental to studies that seek to compare results of sensory measurement and analysis, including studies regarding wine. The new normative framework, {ISO}/{IEC} 17025:2017, which replaces the previous version {ISO}/{IEC} 17025, published in 2005, draws attention to the concept of measurement uncertainty, stating that it should be considered by laboratories when assessing conformity and quantifying risks arising in decision-making processes. The present work examines the evaluation of uncertainty and its importance for the interpretation of results from sensory analyses, examining sensory analysis tests related to the certification of the Designation of Origin "Dão", the Designation of Origin "Lafões" and the Geographical Indication "Terras do Dão", carried out by a panel composed of 20 tasters of the Dão Regional Wine Commission, trained and accredited by the standard {NP} {ISO}/{IEC} 17025:2018. The results achieved led to a conclusion that the panel presented different values of uncertainty regarding the tests to determine sensory attributes. The results and respective values of uncertainty made it possible to assess the performance of the panel of tasters and to establish a level of risk (false accept, false reject and statistical assumptions) for decision rules used when issuing statements of conformity. In this study, a new methodology was presented to determine an estimate of uncertainty to be applied in the interpretation of results related to sensory analysis tests of wines for the certification of Designation of Controlled Origin "Dão", Designation of Origin "Lafões" and Geographical Indication "Terras do Dão. This progress led to an evolution in the day-to-day work of the Dão Regional Wine Commission tasting chamber enabling greater solidity in the opinions issued, in line with the requirements of the reference standard {NP} {ISO}/{IEC} 17025: 2018.},

	abstract = {Monovarietal wines produced in different wine-growing areas may have completely different sensory profiles. As a result, they may be suitable for sale in different regions, depending on local preferences. Better insight into the sensory and chemical profiles of these wines can be helpful in further optimizing commercial strategies and matching supply and demand, which is the main challenge for global wine traders. The training of dedicated sensory panels, together with the correlation of the evaluated attributes with chemical parameters, followed by validation of the obtained models, may yield an improved picture of the overall features associated with products from a specific region. Eighteen samples of international Chardonnay and eighteen samples of international Sauvignon Blanc wines were collected from nine world origins (Northern Italy, Southern Italy, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa). The overall quality judgement ({OQJ}) and the sensory attributes were evaluated by a panel trained with a {MRATA} (Modified Rate-All-That-Apply) method. Moreover, volatile compounds were analysed by {HS}-{SPME}-{GC} × {GC}-{ToF}/{MS} and the phenolic composition, including proanthocyanidins, was determined using {HPLC}-{QqQ}/{MS}. The processing of the data using different multivariate analysis methods, such as multiple factor analysis ({MFA}), was essential to gain insight into the quality of the samples. The profile of cyclic and non-cyclic oligomeric proanthocyanidins was found to be substantially dependent on the grape variety used in the wines (varietal markers), despite the country of origin of the wine influencing it to a limited extent. The results from the same samples analysed by a sensory panel from Germany and ours were qualitatively compared, highlighting the presence of potential factors inherent to the panels themselves that could influence the different judgments and quality classification of the wines. Consequently, the combination of sensory and chemical analysis, by means of the application of multivariate statistical methods presented in this study proves to be a powerful tool for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the quality of the wines under investigation. Overall quality was described as a combination of the sensory attributes, according to the perception process. The attributes were in turn described based on the chemical profiles, which were determined independently by analytical techniques. Eventually, this approach can be very useful not only for basic research on wine quality but also as a tool to aid business-related decision-making activities of wineries and wine traders and to create models that can aid the refinement of marketing strategies.},

            The study of terroir, increasingly popular in scientific circles, remains a challenging field, particularly in terms of sensory analysis. This paper summarizes our own contribution to the field—an approach for tracing the typicity of wines by sensometrics, using the Malbec variety as a case study. This large-scale research fingerprinted 81 wines from 29 parcels from highly contrasting environments (varying climate, elevation, and soils), produced under standardized conditions in three consecutive vintages. Wines were evaluated through descriptive sensory analysis ({DA}) by a trained panel, and sensory descriptors were associated with different size geographic scales (zones, departments, and Geographic Indications ({GIs})). The application of different sensometric tools allowed us to describe the typicity of wines and discriminate each region, proposing a novel methodology for the comprehensive evaluation of terroir from a sensory viewpoint. The vintage effect was very strong at the departmental and {GI} level, with aroma, taste and mouthfeel descriptors varying annually. However, certain origin descriptors remained consistent, providing insight into the typicity of Malbec. Considering the extension of the experimental study performed, this methodology provides a proof of concept for understanding both terroir and vintage effects from a sensorial perspective, offering wine producers and consumers a clear message backed by scientific evidence.},

Volatile compounds of Xinomavro wines produced using a common vinification protocol were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and sensory descriptive analysis was carried out with a trained panel. Wines were characterized by the presence of fatty acids, ethyl and acetate esters, and alcohols, with contributions from terpenes and a volatile phenol. The most active aroma compounds were determined to be 3-methylbutyl acetate, β-damascenone, ethyl esters of octanoic and hexanoic acids, and eugenol. Those compounds positively correlated with fruity and spicy odor descriptors, with the wines being mostly characterized by five typical aroma terms: strawberry, berry fruit, spices, tomato, and green bell pepper. Partial least squares regression ({PLSR}) analysis was used to visualize relationship between the orthonasal sensory attributes and the volatile aroma compounds with calculated {OAVs} {\textgreater} 1. Key aroma-active volatiles in the wines were identified using {GC}-{MS}/olfactometry, providing a list of 40 compounds, among which 13 presented a modified detection frequency {\textgreater} 70\%.

Multiple factor analysis ({MFA}) was applied to achieve a comprehensive map of the quality of the samples while multivariate regression models were applied to each varietal wine to determine the sensory attributes influencing {OQJ} the most and to understand how the combinations of the volatile compounds influenced the olfactory sensory attributes. For Pinot Gris wine, {OQJ} was positively correlated with sensory attributes, like “floral” aroma, “stone-fruit” flavor, “yellow” color, “caramelized” aroma, and “tropical fruit” aroma according to an Italian panel. For Pinot Noir wine, “licorice” aroma, “cloves” aroma, “fresh wood” aroma, “red fruit” flavor, “cherry” aroma, and “spicy” flavor were positively correlated with {OQJ} by the same panel. Important predictors for the wine quality of Pinot Gris could be characterized, but not for Pinot Noir. Additionally, sensory tests were also carried out by different panel compositions (German and Italian). Both the German and the Italian panels preferred (based on {OQJ}) a Pinot Gris wine from New Zealand (Gisborne), but for different perceived characteristics (fruity and aromatic notes by the Italian panel and acidity by the German panel). For Pinot Noir, different panel compositions influenced the {OQJ} of the wines, as the wines from Chile (with more spicy, red fruit and woody notes) were preferred by the Italian panel, while the German panels preferred the wines from Argentina (with light, subtle woody and red fruit notes). The profile of cyclic and non-cyclic proanthocyanidins was also evaluated in the two varietal wines. No clear effect of the origin was observed, but the wines from Italy (Sicily/Puglia) were separated from the rest and were characterized by percentage ratio chemical indexes (\%C-4) and (\%C-5) for both varieties.},

	abstract = {Although the definition of natural wine remains contested and still lacks official recognition, it can be broadly described as a wine made with organic or biodynamic grapes without oenological additives in the cellar and minimal intervention in all winemaking stages. Despite growing interest in natural wines, uncertainty prevails about their sensory and quality attributes among both consumers and experts. In light of this research gap, this study aims to determine, first, if there are specific sensory dimensions allowing to differentiate natural wine as a wine category from conventional wines; second, if this sensory dimension affects the perception of the quality; and third, to characterise the physicochemical differences in terms of basic oenological parameters between natural wines and their conventional counterparts. To do so, 24 red wines (12 self-defined as natural and 12 conventional wines) were sensory and chemically characterised. The sensory evaluation was first carried out by winemakers from Spain. It consisted of a descriptive task (labelled sorting task) followed by a quality evaluation under two conditions: with and without information regarding the production method. A second panel of French experts carried out the same quality assessment, also with and without information. The aim was to find out whether expectations existed linked to each type of wine and to explore potential cross-cultural effects. The results of the labelled sorting task showed that natural wines tended to be different from conventional wines, but the difference was not clear-cut. However, natural wines were perceived to be of lower quality than their conventional counterparts, both with and without the information provided, regardless of the origin of winemakers. Results of the chemical analysis showed that natural wines presented higher values for volatile and total acidity and turbidity, while they had lower values for total and free sulphur. The study points to the existence of sensory dimensions with an impact on overall quality associated with the production method.},

	abstract = {Pinot blanc is a grape variety found in all wine-growing regions of Austria. However, there are only few scientific studies which deal with the aroma of wines of this variety. In the course of this project, the relationship between aroma profile and the typicity of Austrian Pinot blanc wines was studied. The aim was to describe the typicity and to find significant differences in aroma profiles and aroma descriptors of typical and atypical Pinot blanc wines. Since the typicity of a jointly anchored prototype is embedded in the memory, typical attributes for Austrian Pinot blanc wines were first identified by consumers and experts or producers. According to this, 131 flawless commercial Austrian wines of the variety Pinot blanc of the vintages 2015 to 2017 were analysed for more than 100 volatile substances. The wines of the vintages 2015 to 2017 were judged by a panel of producers and experts for their typicity; furthermore, the wines of the vintage 2017 were also evaluated by a consumer panel and a trained descriptive panel. Subsequently, typical and atypical wines were described by the trained descriptive panel. It was found that Pinot blanc wines typical of Austria showed significantly higher concentrations of the ester compounds ethyl hexanoate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl hexanoate, hexyl acetate and isoamyl acetate, while atypical wines had higher concentrations of free monoterpenes such as linalool, trans-linalool oxide, nerol oxide, nerol and alpha-terpineol. The sensory description of typical Pinot blanc wines was significantly more pronounced for the attribute “yellow pome fruit”, and tended to be more pronounced for the attributes “green pome fruit”, “pear”, “walnut”, “pineapple”, “banana” and “vanilla”, while the atypical Pinot blanc wines were described more by the attribute “citrus”. These findings could help to ensure that, through targeted measures, Austrian Pinot blanc wines become even more typical and distinguish themselves from other origins such as Germany or South Tyrol through a clear concept of typicity.},

The fusion models derived from extreme learning machine ({ELM}) were built with {PCA} scores of E-nose and tongue as the inputs. Results showed superior performance (100\% recognition rate) using combination of odor and taste sensors than individual artificial systems.

In the ﬁrst phase of analysis, the wine tasters identiﬁed 37 aromatic descriptors in ﬁve sessions. The descriptors were then reduced to 17 using statistical methods. In the second phase, the wine tasters identiﬁed and rated the intensity of these descriptors for each wine evaluated. Characteristic aromatic descriptors were found in Albariño wines from each particular area. Seven sensory attributes were signiﬁcantly different (p {\textless}{\textless}{\textless}{\textless}{\textless} 0.05) between the wines (Ripe Fruit, Lactic, Pineapple, Banana, Pear, Citrus fruit and Floral). Principal component analysis of the sensory data permitted differentiation between Albariño wines from different geographic areas in Rías Baixas. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Potential terroir effects are described that might impact Riesling wine varietal character. In 2005, the Vintners Quality Alliance of Ontario created putative sub-appellations within the Niagara Peninsula based on soil and climate. The objective of this research was to determine differences that might validate sub-appellation designations. It was hypothesized that differences in fruit composition and wine sensory attributes would be found among these sub-appellations. This was tested in 10 commercial Riesling vineyards representative of each sub-appellation from which wines were made in 2005 and 2006. Vineyards were delineated using {GPS} and 75 to 80 sentinel vines were georeferenced within a sampling grid. An assumption was that vine water status would play a major role in the terroir effect; therefore, wines were made from vines of similar water status based on leaf water potential. A standard winemaking protocol was used to minimize enological effects. Descriptive analysis using a trained panel indicated that sub-appellation affected wine sensory profiles for both vintages. Thirteen aroma, flavor, and taste attributes differed among sub-appellations in 2005 and 11 aroma, flavor, and taste attributes differed in 2006. In both vintages, musts and wines also differed among sub-appellations in chemical composition (titratable acidity, {pH}, and free and potentially volatile terpenes). Through principal component analysis and partial least squares regression, specific sensory and chemical attributes and vineyard variables were associated with wines from the different sub-appellations. However, wines were grouped by their generalized regional designation (Lakeshore, Escarpment, or Lake Plain) within the Niagara Peninsula. Similar sensory profiles were found in these appellations, suggesting wines classified by their place of origin on the Niagara Peninsula should exhibit specific varietal characteristics regardless of growing season.},

Currently, sensor instruments find application in a variety of fields, including environmental, (bio)medical, food, pharmaceutical, and materials production. Particularly the latter, has seen a significant increase in the adoption of technological tools to assess food quality, gradually supplanting human panelists and thus reshaping the entire quality control paradigm in the sector. This process is happening even more rapidly in the world of wine, where olfactory sensory analysis has always played a central role in attributing certain qualities to a wine. In this review, conducted using sources such as {PubMed}, Science Direct, and Web of Science, we examined papers published between January 2015 and January 2024. The aim was to explore prevailing trends in the use of human panels and sensory tools (such as the E-nose) in the wine industry. The focus was on the evaluation of wine quality attributes by paying specific attention to geographical origin, sensory defects, and monitoring of production trends. Analyzed results show that the application of E-nose-type sensors performs satisfactorily in that trajectory. Nevertheless, the integration of this type of analysis with more classical methods, such as the trained sensory panel test and with the application of destructive instrument volatile compound ({VOC}) detection (e.g., gas chromatography), still seems necessary to better explore and investigate the aromatic characteristics of wines.},

Thus, the aim of this research was to identify the sensory characteristics that contribute to deﬁne typicality of young South American red wines based on their varietal and origin, and to evaluate the effect of the vintage on this identiﬁcation. To achieve this objective, visual appearance, odor, and taste of 138 wines from 2 vintages were submitted to a sensory evaluation using a descriptive analysis complemented with the frequency of citation method, performed by wine experts. The intensity of 17 odor and taste attributes was evaluated using a 5 points rating structured scale. The panel performance evaluation demonstrated its high level of expertise and reproducibility. The wines were separated into 3 clusters by multivariate analyses. Cluster 1 was primarily composed of Carm´en`ere, Malbec, and Syrah wines from Chile. Cluster 2 was predominantly composed of Tannat wines from Uruguay and Brazil, while Cluster 3 contained a higher proportion of Malbec and Merlot wines from Argentina and Brazil. Cabernet Sauvignon was equally distributed into all clusters. Wine experts were able to identify the wines according to their varietal and origin, suggesting that there is typicality in young South American red wines. The combination of descriptive analysis with the frequency of citation was useful in characterizing most of the wines, but the typicality perceived by the panelists was not achieved by multivariate analysis. Vintage did not alter the sensory characterization of the wines, and this result could be due the new viticulture or oenological practices used by the winemakers to compensate the environmental variation.},

	abstract = {Terroir is about the link between wine and its origin. It has long been understood by sensory evaluation that the taste of wine from a given variety can be related to its origins. Specific organoleptic characteristics of wine are influenced by environmental factors such as soil and climate. By deconstructing the effect of measurable soil and climate parameters on grape and wine aroma compounds, the terroir effect on wine typicity can be better understood. Climate influences on vine development and grape ripening are mainly associated with temperature, radiation and rainfall, while soil influences are primarily associated with water availability and nitrogen supply. Significant advances have been made over recent years in understanding wine aromas and their molecular basis and influences of climate and soil on a wide range of molecules responsible for wine aroma expression. This article aims to review these recent research advances to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of how terroir influences wine typicity. The effect of terroir on wine quality and typicity is sometimes considered intangible and difficult to explain on a scientific basis. By combining agronomic, analytical and sensory approaches, however, this review shows that the terroir effect is mediated by measurable factors that can easily be monitored in the vineyard. Assessment of the results compiled by this review allows the suggestion that terroir expression at specific sites might be maximized by choosing appropriate plant material in relation to soil and climate, by acting on manageable parameters like vine water and nitrogen status, or by implementing canopy management to modify microclimate in the bunch zone.},

Concomitantly, a sensorial analysis of the produced wines was performed. Ultra-high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ({UHPLC}-Q-{ToF}-{MS}/{MS}) was applied to identify grape and wine metabolites. Untargeted metabolomics was used to identify putative biomarkers for terroir differentiation. More than 40 compounds were identiﬁed, including 28 phenolic compounds and 15 organic acids. The intensity evolution of the analyzed chemical compounds showed similar behavior during the fermentation process in both terroirs. However, the metabolic analysis of the grape, must and wine samples enabled the identiﬁcation of an anthocyanin, chrysanthemin, as a putative biomarker of terroir 1. The overall sensorial quality of the wines was also evaluated, and according to the hitherto reported results, the wines from site 1 scored better than the wines from site 2.

This paper proposes a new approach for validation of this type of methods. A part of the validation procedure requires a description of qualitative aspects: the method’s goal and purpose and adequateness of the sample sets used. The required quantitative performance is assessed from probabilistic data. Probability distributions are generalized using kernel density estimates, which allow meaningful interpolation and direct comparison and combination of different distributions. We propose inclusion of a permutation test, and provide suggestions for the assessment of the analytical repeatability in the method’s probabilistic units. The latter can serve as a quality control measure. For assessment of the method’s overall performance, we propose to apply the combined cross validation and external validation set probability distributions in order to obtain the best estimate for the method’s performance on future samples. Qualitative and quantitative aspects are to be combined into a validation dossier stating performance for a well-deﬁned purpose and scope. The proposed validation approach is applied to a case study: a binary classiﬁcation discriminating organic from conventional laying hen feed based on fatty acid proﬁling that is essential to ensure the organic status of eggs for human consumption. For this case study, an expected accuracy for organic feed recognition of 96\% is obtained for an explicitly deﬁned scope.},

This study monitored the physicochemical parameters, phenolic compound contents, and antioxidant capacity of the red grape Vitis vinifera L. “Cabernet Sauvignon” harvested in three Mexican vineyards during the ﬁrst nine days of the fermentation process. The bioactive compounds and elemental composition (determined by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry, {ICP}-{OES}) were correlated. The fermentation process decreased from 22 to 5 ◦Bx in all cases, while the acidity increased from 6.5 to 8 g of tartaric acid/L, decreasing the {pH}. The phenolic compounds extracted during the winemaking ranged from 1400 to 1600 gallic acid equivalent/L, while the antioxidant capacity was 9 mmol Trolox equivalent. The bioactive compounds identiﬁed by {HPLC} were resveratrol, piceid, catechin, and epicatechin. The presence of Na, Mg, and Fe was correlated with antioxidant capacity, while higher Mn, Pb, Zn, and Cu contents were related to the presence of resveratrol, piceid, and catechin in Cabernet Sauvignon wine. Thus, certain minerals present in the soil that were transferred to the V. vinifera grapes can inﬂuence the amount and type of bioactive compounds present in the wine. The phenolic content and, therefore, the organoleptic characteristics of the wine are related to the mineral composition of the vine-growing soil (origin).},

	abstract = {Non-targeted Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy is a promising approach for wine authentication. A prerequisite for its application in official control is the inter-laboratory comparability, which has rarely been the subject of research studies so far. For the first time, in this study an instrument comparison was carried out in order to investigate the extent and impact of instrumental differences on the classification of wine grape varieties. Following a harmonized protocol for sample preparation, spectra acquisition and processing, the same sample set, comprising of 101 red and 100 white wine samples, was analyzed with two {NMR} spectrometers of the same vendor in different laboratories. Observed spectral differences (intensity, baseline, chemical shift of {pHsensitive} signals) were accounted for by applying an instrument-specific conversion factor or normalization to total intensity, respectively. Partial Least Squares – Discriminant Analysis ({PLS}-{DA}) and Principal Component Analysis – Linear Discriminant Analysis ({PCA}-{LDA}) classification models built with data from the individual instruments and with combined data from both instruments achieved comparable accuracies in the internal validation (79–87\%). When classification models of the individual instruments were used to predict data of the respective other instrument, results were inconsistent, whereas the use of combined data from both instruments for training and test sets produced more robust and reliable results. This study represents an important step towards harmonization of non-targeted analytical approaches and may help in the development of jointly used databases for food authentication.},

In the scientific environment, especially non-targeted approaches are becoming increasingly popular here, although their routine applicability, e.g., in official food control, is currently limited. The comparability of spectra acquired by different spectroscopic instruments using the same measurement principle is essential for the application of a common spectral database in laboratories and represents a current challenge in this field. In order to investigate possible approaches towards improved comparability of these spectra, a sample set of rapeseed (Brassica napus) and pumpkin seed (Cucurbita maxima) oils was analyzed using three Fourier-transform-mid-infrared spectrometers following the same procedure for sample preparation and measuring conditions. Depending on the instrument, the obtained spectra exhibited differences in absorbance, but not in wavelengths of bands position and maxima. As a result, the mutual prediction of original data (without mathematical correction) from different instruments using a partial least squares discriminant analysis model built and optimized with spectral data from only one instrument provided a sensitivity of 0\% for the two-class model of rapeseed in pumpkin seed oil, indicating no discrimination at all. In order to minimize the spectral differences and thus to enhance the performance parameters of the prediction models, different mathematical correction approaches were investigated: (i) instrument-specific correction factors, (ii) combinations of different pre-processing steps and (iii) piecewise direct standardization (partial least squares-based regression). All investigated approaches achieved classification results with 100\% sensitivity for the mathematically corrected data set of the respective instrument. The outcome of this study indicates that the correction approaches can be used to optimize the comparability of spectral data from different instruments, which is a first step towards harmonization in non-targeted analysis.},

              One of the main food risks gaining attention from industry, governments, and standards-setting organizations is fraud conducted for economic gain by food producers, manufacturers, processors, distributors, or retailers. The infrared ({IR}) spectrum originates from the absorption of different frequencies by a sample positioned in the path of an {IR} beam (
              e.g.
              near or mid infrared beams) determining the {IR} fingerprint of a given sample. This fingerprint signal contains most of the relevant (chemical, physical, process) information related to the sample allowing tracing its origin. The aim of this article is to highlight different applications of the main vibrational spectroscopy (near, mid and Raman spectroscopy) techniques as tools to assess fraud and counterfeit issues in foods. Examples of such applications include samples of milk, fish, meat, olive oil as well as other agricultural products and foods.},

Principal component analyses on intra-vintage metabolomic data presented a good reproducibility in relation to geographic coordinates. A correlation-driven approach was used to explore the combined inﬂuence of soil and topographic variables on metabolomic responses. As a result, a metabolic cluster including ﬂavonoids was correlated with elevation and curvature.

In addition to endangering consumers’ health, by the presence of dangerous chemicals, counterfeit spirits market is imposing significant financial liability for the genuine suppliers as well as constitute in substantial loss of revenue for governments. The counterfeiting dynamics, the hardship of detecting counterfeit spirits, and the difficulty in using the available analytical methods may result in delays on the reports, inconclusive results, and lack of proof of the materiality of the crime. Counterfeiting process generally take places by refilling bottles of brand spirits with cheaper ones or even produced by counterfeiters and then resealing with the same authentic bottle caps. Fortunately, this practice can leave traces of evidence in bottle caps, which could be used to identify counterfeit spirits. This work shows that Infrared Spectroscopy and {TimeDomain} Nuclear Magnetic Resonance can be used to identify counterfeit spirits based on the analysis of its bottle caps, being valuable tools in the battle against counterfeit product market.},

Among the most popular grape varieties are Kallmet, Shesh i zi ({ShiZ}), Shesh i bardh¨e ({ShiB}), and Cerruje, which are known for their distinctive wines as well as the planted area. A study was conducted to investigate the influence of the territory and vintage on phenolic compounds of single-variety wines from these grape varieties. Liquid chromatography identified and quantified thirty-one phenolic compounds, sub-grouped into flavonoids and non-flavonoids, with diode-array detection coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}–{DAD}–{ESI}/{MSn}). Within the red wines group, the {ShiZ} variety wine presented the highest phenolic content (1037 mg/L), followed by Kallmet cv. (539 mg/L); conversely, in the white wine group, the {ShiB} wines (699 mg/L) were distinguished from the Cerruje variety. Gallic acid was the main phenolic compound, followed by procyanidin B3. {ShiB} and {ShiZ} had the highest levels, at 215 and 136 mg/L, respectively. Among flavanols, (+)-catechin was found in the highest levels, with the maximum in Kallmet cv. red wine (58.9 mg/L), followed by (-)-epicatechin (29.1 mg/L). The {ShiB} wine had the highest content of flavonols, with quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and quercetin-3-O-glucoside as the main contributors. The highest quantity of stilbenoids belonged to Kallmet red wine (1.59 mg/L). Applying Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) in red and white wine groups made a good separation possible according to variety and region. However, a separation according to vintage year was not successful.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy coupled multivariate analysis (1H {NMRPCA}/{PLS}-{DA}) is an important tool for the discrimination of wine products. Although 1H {NMR} has been shown to discriminate wines of different cultivars, a grape genetic component of the discrimination has been inferred only from discrimination of cultivars of undefined genetic homology and in the presence of many confounding environmental factors. We aimed to confirm the influence of grape genotypes in the absence of those factors.
Methods and Results We applied 1H {NMR}-{PCA}/{PLS}-{DA} and hierarchical cluster analysis ({HCA}) to wines from five, variously genetically-related grapevine (V. vinifera) cultivars; all grown similarly on the same site and vinified similarly. We also compared the semi-quantitative profiles of the discriminant metabolites of each cultivar with previously reported chemical analyses. The cultivars were clearly distinguishable and there was a general correlation between their grouping and their genetic homology as revealed by recent genomic studies. Between cultivars, the relative amounts of several of the cultivar-related discriminant metabolites conformed closely with reported chemical analyses.
Conclusions Differences in grape-derived metabolites associated with genetic differences alone are a major source of 1H {NMR}-based discrimination of wines and 1H {NMR} has the capacity to discriminate between very closely related cultivars.},

According to the food legislation, wines can be without geographical origin (table wine) and wines with origin. Wines with origin must have characteristics which are essential due to its region of production and must be produced, processed and prepared, exclusively within that region. The development of fast and reliable analytical methods for the assessment of claims of origin is very important. The current ofﬁcial method is based on the measurement of stable isotope ratios of water and alcohol in wine, which are inﬂuenced by climatic factors. The results in this paper are based on 5220 Italian wine samples collected in the period 2000–2010. We evaluate the univariate approach underlying the ofﬁcial method to assess claims of origin and propose several new methods to get better geographical discrimination between samples. It is shown that multivariate methods are superior to univariate approaches in that they show increased sensitivity and speciﬁcity. In cases where data are non-normally distributed, an approach based on mixture modelling provides additional improvements.},

Musts (i.e., grape juice) and base wines were also analyzed to study the evolution of the Sr isotopic ratio during the elaboration process of sparkling wine. The results demonstrate that there is a very homogeneous Sr isotopic ratio (87Sr/86Sr = 0.70812, n = 37) and a narrow span of variability (2σ = 0.00007, n = 37). Moreover, the Sr concentrations in Champagnes have also low variability, which can be in part explained by the homogeneity of the bedrock in the {AOC} Champagne. Measurements of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio from musts and base wines show that blending during Champagne production plays a major role in the limited variability observed. Further, the 87Sr/86Sr of the musts were closely linked to the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the vineyard soil. It appears that the 87Sr/86Sr of the product does not change during the elaboration process, but its variability decreases throughout the process due to blending. Both the homogeneity of the soil composition in the Champagne {AOC} and the blending process during the wine making process with several blending steps at different stages account for the unique and stable Sr isotopic signature of the Champagne wines.},

Having in mind the commercial and historical significance of rare and aged wines, this study focuses on noninvasive and nondestructive 137Cs detection. The approach relies on measuring gamma-emitting radionuclides within the energy range of 46.5− 1836 {keV} using Hyper Pure Germanium ({HPGe}) detectors, specifically calibrated for horizontally positioned sealed wine bottles. The 137Cs dating method was optimized to achieve low detection limits and was validated for accuracy. All the activities were normalized to the same arbitrary date, and each sample was measured twice. For the first time, Portuguese fortified and nonfortified wines were analyzed for 137Cs content. Wines from the 1960−1965 vintages exhibited 137Cs levels between 0.51 Bq/L and 1.74 Bq/ L, varying by wine region and type. Fortified wines consistently showed lower 137Cs levels than nonfortified wines, likely due to differences in the production process. The method is particularly effective for distinguishing wines produced around the 1963 bomb peak and a few subsequent years, though further research is needed to expand its applicability to other periods.},

	abstract = {Greek wines made from the indigenous grape varieties Assyrtiko, Malagousia, Moschofilero and Roditis are attracting the interest of wine producers and consumers due to their aromatic characteristics. However, there are few studies that focus on the unique wine characteristics of each variety and the relationship between the composition of volatile compounds and sensory properties. Monovarietal white wines (2018 vintage) were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry to quantify 34 volatile compounds. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to investigate correlations between volatiles and sensory attributes identified by a trained panel. The results showed that the strongest aroma compounds were a group of terpenes, isoamyl acetate and phenylethyl acetate. Terpenes such as geraniol, α-terpineol, linalool and cis-rose oxide correlated with floral notes, especially in Moschofilero wines. In addition, isoamyl acetate contributed to the aroma of tropical fruits, especially banana, in the Roditis wines, while phenylethyl acetate correlated with rose, vanilla and fruity notes in both the Moschofilero and Roditis samples. The Assyrtiko wines and the Malagousia wines were mainly associated with compounds such as cis-3-hexen-1-ol and cis- and trans-furan linalool oxides, which may enhance fresh fruit and citrus aromas through synergistic effects. The common background aroma of the studied wines was mainly determined by higher alcohols, fatty acids and ethyl esters. This study provides a basis for understanding the typical aroma of white wines from indigenous Greek grape varieties, which will help producers develop targeted wine styles and will be useful for consumer promotion.},

This paper describes the use of {ICP}-{MS} and {NMR} to characterise a selection of Pinot noir wines.

An analysis of coinertia suggested that the two datasets were not redundant, and it is proposed that {ICP}-{MS} data is the most useful for determining regionality.},

Adulteration can take many forms, including the addition of sugars, acids, volatile oils, overdilution of concentrate, addition of juices of other fruits, use of concentrate in a fresh product, and use of low-quality product recovered from what are normally waste products of manufacture. Food adulteration has been practiced since ancient times but has become more sophisticated in the recent past. Foods or ingredients most likely to be targets for adulteration include those that are of high value or subject to the vagaries of weather during their growth or harvest. The practice of adulteration commonly arises for two main reasons: ﬁrstly, it can be proﬁtable, and secondly, adulterants can be easily mixed and are subsequently difﬁcult to detect. To counter this problem, manufacturers subject their raw material and by-products to a series of quality controls, including high-performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}), thin-layer chromatography ({TLC}), enzymatic tests, and physical tests. This mini-review highlights recent applications on the use of {NIR} and {MIR} spectroscopy to trace and authenticate natural and agricultural products.},

However, the low spectral resolution of benchtop 1H {NMR} spectroscopy and the complexity of the mixtures hinder the direct quantification of important wine parameters and, thus, prevent its widespread use as an analytical tool in wineries. We show here that these problems can be solved using model-based data processing. In a first step, the accuracy of the new approach was evaluated by analyzing gravimetrically prepared test mixtures representing different fermentation stages. Good agreement was found, demonstrating the reliability of the new method. In a second step, benchtop 1H {NMR} spectroscopy combined with model-based data processing was used for the real-time monitoring of real fermentation media. Wine fermentation processes with different feed strategies (batch and fed-batch) were investigated and compared and the evolution of important wine constituents as well as effects caused by the different feeding strategies were monitored, demonstrating the applicability of the new approach also in demanding applications. This opens the way to using benchtop {NMR} spectroscopy for optimization and decision making in wine production.},

Currently, new metabolomic techniques and proper statistics procedures allow accurate proﬁling of wine metabolome. Thus, the main goal was to evaluate diﬀerent metabolomic methodologies on their ability to provide patterns on the wine metabolome based on selected factors, such as ageing of barrel-aged wine (factor time), prior usage of the barrels (factor barrel-type), and diﬀerences between wine ageing in barrels or glass bottles (factor bottled-wine). In the current study, we implement {NMR}, targeted and untargeted {GC}-{MS} and {LC}-{MS} metabolomic analytical techniques so as to gain insights into the volatile and nonvolatile wine metabolome composition of red wines from two cellars located in the only two Spanish Qualiﬁed Appellations of Origin; {DOQ} Priorat and {DOCa} Rioja regions. Overall, 95 diﬀerentially signiﬁcant metabolites were identiﬁed facilitating the evaluation of the analytical methodologies performance and ﬁnding common trends of those metabolites depending on the considered factor. The results did not favor {NMR} as an eﬀective technique on the current dataset whereas suggested {LC}-{MS} as an adequate technique for revealing diﬀerences based on the factor time, targeted {GC}-{MS} on the factor barrel-type, and untargeted {GC}-{MS} on the factor bottled-wine. Thus, a combination of diﬀerent metabolomic techniques is necessary for a complete overview of the metabolome changes.

On the basis of extracting infrared spectrum of wine, the principal component analysis ({PCA}) – support vector machine ({SVM}) model was modified by chemometrics. A total of 300 grape wine samples were collected from six production areas. The composition of the samples was analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry ({UPLC}-Q-{TOF}-{MS}). According to the experimental results, indole, sulfacetamide and caffeine were selected as characteristics of different origins. Near infrared spectral wavelengths of wine samples were compressed between 900 and 2,500 nm. The ranges of 1,000 nm {\textasciitilde} 1,400 nm and 1,500 nm {\textasciitilde} 1800 nm were selected for {PCA} principal component analysis and key spectral wavelengths were extracted. The unsupervised learning model of {SVM} is used to classify and identify key spectral wavelengths. The experimental results show that the algorithm has higher classification accuracy than traditional {PCA}-{LDA}, {PCA} and other algorithms. The classification accuracy of the algorithm is improved from 98.3 to 99.75\%. The improved {PCA}-{SVM} algorithm can achieve fast and loss-less source tracing of wine.},

The present study focused on assessing the reproducibility of {NMR} spectra of the same matrix when different operators performed individually both the sample preparation and the measurements using their spectrometer. For this purpose, two independent laboratories prepared 63 tomato samples according to a previously optimized procedure and recorded the corresponding 1D 1H {NMR} spectra. A classification model was built using the spectroscopic fingerprint data delivered by the two laboratories to assess the geographical origin of the tomato samples. The performance of the optimized statistical model was satisfactory, with a 97.62\% correct sample classification rate.

Analysis of wine metabolites is very often used to understand the impact of geographical origin or variety on wine quality. {NMR} is often used for tracing the geographical origin of wine. Research on {NMR} metabolic effects of geographical origin is of great importance as the high added value of wines results from compliance with state legislation on the protected denomination of origin ({PDO}) and protected geographical indication ({PGI}) for the administration of the appellation of wines. A review of {NMR} with emphasis on {SNIF}-{NMR} in the analysis of wine authenticity is given. {SNIF}-{NMR} remains a method of choice for the detection of wine chaptalization as it is the only approach which provides position-speciﬁc information on the origin of sugar in wine. However, the sample preparation step, which lacks major improvements since its conception, is strenuous and expensive, and suffers from drawbacks in terms of low sample throughput. Mainstream 1D and 2D {NMR} experiments provide a fast and affordable way to authenticate wine based on the geographical origin, vintage, and variety discrimination, and include a simple and non-destructive sample preparation step.

In this review, we describe the developments in data acquisition and multivariate analysis of {NMR}-based metabolomics data, with particular emphasis on the metabolomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid ({CSF}) and biomarker discovery in Multiple Sclerosis ({MScl}).},

	abstract = {Validation of multivariate models is of current importance for a wide range of chemical applications. Although important, it is neglected. The common practice is to use a single external validation set for evaluation. This approach is deficient and may mislead investigators with results that are specific to the single validation set of data. In addition, no statistics are available regarding the precision of a derived figure of merit ({FOM}). A statistical approach using bootstrapped Latin partitions is advocated. This validation method makes efficient use of the data because each object is used once for validation. It was reviewed a decade earlier but primarily for optimization of chemometric models1, this review presents the reasons it should be used for generalized statistical validation. Average {FOMs} with confidence intervals are reported and powerful, matched-sample statistics may be applied for comparing models and methods. Examples demonstrate the problems with single validation sets.},

Due to the complexity of the experimental data, which was characterized by a high number of variables, special attention was given to the preprocessing phase in order to identify the most relevant input space for each envisaged classification criterion. The obtained results have shown that 1H-{NMR} spectroscopy in conjunction with Logistic Regression represents a reliable approach for wine traceability, leading, for all investigated classification criteria, to accuracy scores of the developed models greater than 98\% in cross-validation and up to 100\% in testing.},

	abstract = {Spanish fortified wines with Protected Designation of Origin ({PDO}) are esteemed for their deep-rooted tradition, historical significance, and exceptional viticultural quality. Spain boasts four {PDOs}: ‘Condado de Huelva’, ‘{JerezX}´ere`s-Sherry’, ‘Sanlúcar de Barrameda’, and ‘Montilla-Moriles’, which produce different types of wines—Fino and Manzanilla undergo biological aging, Olorosos experience oxidative aging, and Amontillados benefit from mixed aging. Due to their long aging periods and significant production costs and hence, their high value, these wines are susceptible to fraud, emphasizing the necessity for robust authentication methods. In response to this need, this study explores emerging technologies, such as spectroscopic techniques coupled with different chemometric approaches, to offer rapid, straightforward, and cost-effective solutions to ensure the authenticity of {PDO} wines. A comprehensive set of {PDO} fortified wines, encompassing various types and origins, was analyzed by near and mid-infrared ({NIR} and {MIR}) and ultraviolet–visible ({UV}–Vis) spectroscopies. Preprocessed data were modelled individually, as well as after low-level data fusion, using partial least squares-discriminant analysis ({PLS}-{DA}) and a new available chemometric tool named Automatic Hierarchical Model Builder ({AHIMBU}). The results obtained showed that the hierarchical classification model generated by {AHIMBU} outperformed the single {PLS}-{DA} models, offering enhanced classification accuracy and efficiency (i.e., the correct classification rate increased by around 40 \% from the single {PLS}-{DA} models to the {AHIMBU} models). Among the spectroscopic techniques applied, {UV}–Vis spectroscopy emerged as the most effective for authentication purposes.},

	abstract = {The adulteration of wine with glycerol is considered to be a problem in European wine-producing countries. The latest control methods are mainly based on the detection of impurities from commercial products, but suffer from the raising efficiency of the purification processes. As there is little chance of being able to identify glycerol from different sources on the basis of a method which uses only one isotope, a multielement approach was tested. Glycerol from wine showed the lowest relative enrichment with D, mainly in position C-2, a relatively high 18O content, and very negative d13C values, which significantly correlated with those of ethanol from the same wines. The isotopic data of glycerol samples from different sources were in agreement with those given by indices of origin (impurities). These data allowed us to identify the origin of these glycerol samples, i.e. whether they were produced industrially or synthesised by animals or plants. Glycerol of plant origin was most similar to glycerol found in wine. The combination of several isotopic data by discriminance analysis yielded clusters of data obtained from glycerol samples of similar origin. Taking into account the characteristics of possible mixtures, proof that wine has been adulterated depends on the origin and isotope levels of the added compound. This study showed that it is possible to prove that wine has been adulterated with glycerol from other sources when the latter is present at a concentration of 15\% of the total glycerol content.},

	abstract = {The new methodological approach of rapid evaluation of intracellular grape and wine water without sample preparation, based on the quantitative nuclear magnetic deuterium spectroscopy (2H(D)-{qNMR}) is suggested and developed under the research program carried out under the scientific grant of the International Organization of Vine and Wine (O.I.V.). The approach provides a quantitative high precision measurement of the deuterium content in water based on the direct dependence of the areas of {NMR} signals on the number of nuclei responsible for these signals. The developed approach uses similar to the well-known {SNIF}-{NMR} method with an internal reference substance ({IRS}) - dimethyl sulfoxide ({DMSO}). The {IRS} signals in the {NMR} spectrum do not overlap with the signals of main components of the analyte (e.g., grape must/juice, wine). In addition, it is possible to change the deuterium content using an available {NMR} solvent - {DMSO}-d6. At the same time, the amount of deuterium in the {IRS}-{DMSO} is increased by adding {DMSO}-d6 so that the proportion of the standard, equal to 10-15\% by volume, gives a signal commensurate in its intensity with the signal of water contained in the analyte. The exact amount of deuterium in the {IRS} is determined by comparing the integral intensities of signals in the 2H(D)-{NMR} spectrum in a standard water sample ({VSMOW}) with a known deuterium content. After calibration of the deuterium content in {IRS}, the analyte and {DMSO} in quantities of 0.5 and 0.075 ml, respectively, are placed in a standard tube, then the 2H(D)-{NMR} spectrum is measured in the following conditions: 90° pulse, 2.5 sec acquisition time, 3 sec delay relaxation, 1000 scans. Additionally, to assess the amount of water in the analyte, the 1H-{NMR} spectrum is recorded, from which the contents of main sample components, for example, ethanol, glycerol, sugars, etc., are determined. The calculation of the deuterium content is carried out by quantifying the integral intensities of the {IRS} signals and the water contained in the sample. The developed methodological approach has been validated in experimental tests to study the natural content of deuterium in intracellular water of grapes of different seasons, as well as to study changes in the quantitative balance of deuterium in the case of adding extension water to musts before and after fermentation.},

	abstract = {Globalization and free market dynamics have significantly impacted state economies, particularly in the wine industry. These forces have introduced greater diversity in wine products but have also heightened the risk of food fraud, especially in high-value commodities like wine. Due to its market value and the premium placed on quality, wine is frequently subject to adulteration. This issue is often addressed through regulatory trademarks on wine labels, such as Protected Designation of Origin ({PDO}) and Protected Geographic Indication ({PGI}). In this context, the metabolic profiles (organic acids, carbohydrates, and phenols) and stable isotope signatures (δ13C, δ18O, D/{HI}, and D/{HII}) of red and white wines from four agroclimatically similar regions were examined. The study explored how factors such as grape variety, harvest year, and geographical origin affect wine composition, with a particular focus on distinguishing samples from cross-border areas. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to assess the variability in wine composition and to identify distinct groups of samples. Preliminary results revealed that organic acids and volatile compounds were found in lower concentrations than carbohydrates but were significantly higher than phenols, with levels ranging between 1617 mg/L and 6258 mg/L. Carbohydrate content in the wines varied from 8285 mg/L to 14662 mg/L. Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) indicated certain separation trends based on the variance in carbohydrates (e.g., fructose, glucose, galactose) and isotopic composition. However, Discriminant Analysis ({DA}) provided clear distinctions based on harvest year, variety, and geographical origin.},

Wine samples of diﬀerent grape varieties cultivated in diﬀerent regions in Greece were subjected to 13C {NMR} analysis. The relative integrals of the 13C spectral window were processed and extracted to build a chemical ﬁngerprint for the characterization of each speciﬁc wine variety, and then subjected to factor analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, and k-nearest neighbors analysis. The statistical analysis results showed that the 13C {NMR} ﬁngerprint could be used as a rapid and accurate indicator of the wine variety diﬀerentiation. An almost perfect classiﬁcation rate based on training (99.8\%) and holdout methods (99.9\%) was obtained. Results were further tested on the basis of Cronbach’s alpha reliability analysis, where a very low random error (0.30) was estimated, indicating the accuracy and strength of the aforementioned methodology for the discrimination of the wine variety. The obtained data were grouped according to the geographical origin of wine samples and further subjected to principal component analysis ({PCA}) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis ({PLS}-{DA}). The {PLS}-{DA} and variable importance in projection ({VIP}) allowed the determination of a chemical ﬁngerprint characteristic of each geographical group. The statistical analysis revealed the possibility of acquiring useful information on wines, by simply processing the 13C {NMR} raw data, without the need to determine any speciﬁc metabolomic proﬁle. In total, the obtained ﬁngerprint can be used for the development of rapid quality-control methodologies concerning wine.},

The effects of changes in wine composition due to ageing and the stability of A-{TEEM} models over time had not been addressed, however, and the classification of wine blends required investigation. Thus, A-{TEEM} data were combined with an extreme gradient boosting discriminant analysis ({XGBDA}) algorithm to build classification models based on a range of Shiraz research wines (n = 217) from five Barossa Valley sub-regions over four vintages that had aged in bottle for several years. This spectral fingerprinting and machine learning approach revealed a 100\% class prediction accuracy based on cross-validation ({CV}) model results for vintage year and 98.8\% for unknown sample prediction accuracy when splitting the wine samples into training and test sets to obtain the classification models. The modelling and prediction of sub-regional production area showed a class {CV} prediction accuracy of 99.5\% and an unknown sample prediction accuracy of 93.8\% when modelling with the split dataset. Inputting a sub-set of the current A-{TEEM} data into the models generated previously for these Barossa sub-region wines yielded a 100\% accurate prediction of vintage year for 2018–2020 wines, 92\% accuracy for sub-region for 2018 wines, and 91\% accuracy for sub-region using 2021 wine spectral data that were not included in the original modelling. Satisfactory results were also obtained from the modelling and prediction of blended samples for the vintages and sub-regions, which is of significance when considering the practice of wine blending.},

However, traditional analytical methods for evaluating the quality of {YRW} are very tedious, and there is still a lack of rapid quality assessment methods for {YRW} with different aging times. In this study, taking Jimo rice wine ({JRW}, a representative {YRW} in northern China) with different aging years as the object, traditional analytical methods and various antioxidant experiments were used to characterize their quality differences, a rapid quality evaluation method was established by machine learning combining with the data obtained from Flash {GC} e-nose and near-infrared. The results showed multiple physicochemical parameters coupled with multivariate statistical analysis could distinguish {JRW} with diverse aging years. {JRW} with different aging years also showed various antioxidant capacities and generally increased with the aged years. A total of 24 major aroma components were identified in {JRW}, of which five varied regularly with aging time. Then, the deep learning algorithm (long short-term memory, {LSTM}) showed excellent classification performance (100\% accuracy) in {JRW} with different aging years, and a multi-source information fusion strategy can achieve 100\% classification accuracy even when combined with traditional algorithms. Finally, the fused data improved the accuracy of the {LSTM} regression model in predicting the content of the main physicochemical parameters of {JRW}, with higher R2 and lower {RMSE} compared to data from a single source. Overall, this study clarified the quality differences of {JRW} with diverse aging years, and a rapid and precise method combining multi-source data fusion and machine learning was developed to assess the quality of {JRW}, which could also apply to other beverages or foods.},

The main volatile compounds of the wine were identiﬁed and quantiﬁed. Chemometric techniques were applied to identify features and possible clusters among the different samples.
{RESULTS}: Forty volatile compounds were unambiguously identiﬁed in the 36 wine samples from different producers. The aroma proﬁle was mainly composed of different alcohols and esters but also featured appreciable concentrations of terpenes, aldehydes, and octanoic acid. 2-Methyl benzaldehyde was identiﬁed for the ﬁrst time. A high concentration of isoamyl alcohol signiﬁcantly contributed to the aroma complexity. Differences between producers are highlighted.
{CONCLUSION}: The present work is the ﬁrst report about the volatile proﬁle of Ruché wines investigated by chemometric methods with quantitative results. Multivariate exploratory approaches revealed minor but distinct differences among the studied wines, likely attributable to variations in winemaking procedures.

A scotch near the needle tip provides a ﬁxed micro-volume for each analysis to achieve satisfactory ion signal reproducibility ({RSD} {\textless} 26.7\%). In combination with a machine learning algorithm, 16 characteristic ions were discovered from thousands of detected ions and were utilized for differentiating red wine origin.

	abstract = {Background: Recent statistics from the European Commission indicate that wine is one of the commodities most commonly subject to food fraud. In this context, the development of reliable classiﬁcation models to differentiate alcoholic beverages requires, besides sensitive analytical tools, the use of the most suitable data-processing methods like those based on advanced statistical tools or artiﬁcial intelligence.
Results: The present study aims to establish a new, innovative approach for the differentiation of alcoholic beverages (wines and fruit distillates), which is able to increase the discrimination rate of the models that have been developed. A data dimensionality reduction step was applied to proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-{NMR}) proﬁles. This stage consisted of the application of fuzzy principal component analysis ({FPCA}) prior to the development of classiﬁcation models through discriminant analysis. The enhancement of the model's classiﬁcation potential by the application of {FPCA} in comparison with principal component analysis ({PCA}) was discussed.
Conclusion: The association of 1H-{NMR} spectroscopy and an appropriate statistical approach provided a very effective tool for the differentiation of alcoholic beverages. To develop reliable metabolomic approaches for the differentiation of wines and fruit distillates, 1H-{NMR} spectroscopic data were exploited in conjunction with fuzzy algorithms to reduce data dimensionality. The study proved the greater efﬁciency of using {FPCA} scores in comparison with those obtained through the widely applied {PCA}. The proposed approach enabled wines to be distinguished perfectly according to their geographical origins, cultivar, and vintage, and this could be used for wine classiﬁcation. Moreover, 100\% correctly classiﬁed samples were also achieved for the botanical and geographical differentiation of fruit distillates.},

	abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the application of mid-infrared ({MIR}) spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis, to provide a rapid screening tool for discriminating among different Italian monovarietal red wines based on the relationship between grape variety and wine composition in particular phenolic compounds.Methods and results: The {MIR} spectra (from 4000 to 700 cm‒1) of 110 monovarietal Italian red wines, vintage 2016, were collected and evaluated by selected multivariate data analyses, including principal component analysis ({PCA}), linear discriminant analysis ({DA}), support vector machine ({SVM}), and soft intelligent modelling of class analogy ({SIMCA}). Samples were collected directly from companies across different regions of Italy and included 11 grape varieties: Sangiovese, Nebbiolo, Aglianico, Nerello Mascalese, Primitivo, Raboso, Cannonau, Teroldego, Sagrantino, Montepulciano and Corvina. 
{PCA} showed five wavelengths that mainly contributed to the {PC}1, including a much-closed peak at 1043 cm‒1, which correspond to the C–O stretch absorption bands that are important regions for glycerol, whereas the ethanol peaks at around 1085 cm‒1. The band at 877 cm‒1 are related to the C–C stretching vibration of organic molecules, whereas the asymmetric stretching for C–O in the aromatic –{OH} group of polyphenols is within spectral regions from 1050 to 1165 cm‒1. In particular, the (1175)–1100–1060 cm‒1 vibrational bands are combination bands, involving C–O stretching and O–H deformation of phenolic rings. The 1166–1168 cm‒1 peak is attributable to in-plane bending deformations of C–H and C–O groups of polyphenols, respectively, for which polymerisation may cause a slight peak shift due to the formation of H-bridges.The best result was obtained with the {SVM}, which achieved an overall correct classification for up to 72.2\% of the training set, and 44.4\% for the validation set of wines, respectively. The Sangiovese wines (n=19) were split into two sub-groups (Sang-Romagna, n=12 and Sang-Tuscany, n=7) considering the indeterminacy of its origins, which is disputed between Romagna and Tuscany. Although the classification of three grape varieties was problematic (Nerello Mascalese, Raboso and Primitivo), the remaining wines were almost correctly assigned to their actual classes.Conclusions: {MIR} spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics represents an interesting approach for the classification of monovarietal Italian red wines, which is important in quality control and authenticity monitoring.Significance and impact of the study: Authenticity is a main issue in winemaking in terms of quality evaluation and adulteration, in particular for origin certified/protected wines, for which the added marketing value is related to the link of grape variety with the area of origin. This study is part of the D-wine project “The diversity of tannins in Italian red wines”.},

Therefore, our research group developed a novel method using near-infrared ({NIR}) spectroscopy (1596-2396 nm) coupled with machine learning ({ML}) modeling to assess wine vintages and quality traits based on the intensity of sensory descriptors through the bottle. These were developed using samples from an Australian vineyard for Shirazwines. Models resulted in high accuracy 97\% for classification (vintages) and R=0.95 regression (sensory quality traits). The proposed method will allow to assess authenticity and sensory quality traits of any wines in the market without the need to open the bottles, which is rapid, accurate, effective, and convenient. Furthermore, currently, there are low-cost {NIR} devices available in the market with the required spectral range and sensitivity, which can be affordable for winemakers and retailers that can be used with the {ML} models proposed here.},

While non-targeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) is a powerful and widely used technique in authenticity studies, inter-laboratory or instrument comparison exercises are rare. For the first time, in the present study a comparison of two {LC}-{MS} platforms using identical setups and conditions except for the mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Q Exactive™ Focus vs. Plus) was carried out in order to assess the impact of instrumental differences on the classification of grape varieties in wine. A set of 201 red and white wine samples comprising 10 grape varieties was analyzed with both platforms and subjected to multivariate statistical analysis. Using unsupervised and supervised methods, the same correlation pattern between samples was observed with both platforms. Partial Least Squares – Discriminant Analysis ({PLS}-{DA}) classification models achieved comparable accuracies in the internal validation (90–95\%). The percentage of common discriminating features was about 46–69\% between both platforms. The common features were used to merge data from both instruments and joint {PLS}-{DA} models produced excellent results. The prediction of data from one platform with the model from the other platform, as well as a model using data from both platforms, resulted in correct classification rates of 92–98\%. Putative identification of common features was performed to determine potential marker substances for grape varieties. With this study, a first step towards harmonization of nontargeted {LC}-{MS} approaches for wine authentication is taken, advancing their potential application in official food control.},

Signiﬁcant variations in the concentration of formate, fumarate, pyruvate, succinate, citrate, gallate, acetate, tyrosine, phenylalanine, histidine, γ-aminobutyrate, methionine and choline were statistically suggested as indicators accountable for the discrimination of samples aged under different conditions.

	abstract = {The Touriga Nacional grape variety is renowned in Portuguese red wines for its intense color and aromatic complexity, largely attributed to its rich phenolic composition. Several factors influence the phenolic profile of wines, including edapho-climatic conditions, grape variety, and winemaking techniques such as fermentation, maceration, barrel aging, and maturation. In this study, the technique for winemaking was the only controlled variable, allowing for a specific evaluation of its impact on phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity. Ten single-varietal Touriga Nacional wine samples from the 2019 vintage, produced in the Cima Corgo sub-region of the Douro by different wineries, were analyzed. The phenolic composition was determined using colorimetric methods to quantify total phenols, ortho-diphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and tannins. Antioxidant capacity was assessed through the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ({DPPH}), 2,2′-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt ({ABTS}), and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power ({FRAP}) assays. Since all wines shared the same grape variety, region, and harvest year, the fermentation technique was the main differentiating factor, enabling a direct comparison of its influence on phenolic extraction and antioxidant properties. Additionally, Reversed-Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Photodiode Array Detection coupled with Mass Spectrometry ({RP}-{HPLC}-{DAD}-{ESI}-{MS}/{MS}) was employed to identify and quantify individual phenolic compounds. This study highlights the key role of winemaking techniques in modulating the phenolic composition and antioxidant potential of Touriga Nacional wines.},

	abstract = {The influence of the vineyard location, the yield per vine and the type of alcoholic fermentation on the composition of Merlot wine from two consecutive vintages was investigated in a simultaneous experiment. Grapes from two locations and two crop loads per vine, from controlled and thinned vines, were vinified. At the same time, grapes from control vines were vinified with inoculated and spontaneous alcoholic fermentation. Comparisons of the wine composition were made using a targeted metabolomic approach, microbiological analysis and sensory evaluation. It has been confirmed that the composition of Merlot wine is essentially determined by the location of the vineyard. The analytical marker used to distinguish the two locations was the content of 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (significantly higher in location B with 38–130\%). It has also been shown that the type of alcoholic fermentation has a greater influence on the composition of the wine than the crop load. The analytical marker used for the cluster thinning was the {pH} of the wine, which increased significantly by 0.03 to 0.08 units with the lower crop load, and for the type of alcoholic fermentation, the concentration of 2-phenethyl acetate, which relates to the sum of acetates and 2-phenylethanol, which increased significantly by 58–299\%, 54–218\%, and 24–46\% in the spontaneously fermented wines. Both the location of the vineyard and spontaneous alcoholic fermentation influenced the significant differences in the sensory characteristics of the wine, while cluster thinning had no such influence. The other influences of the two technical factors on the wine composition depended on the location of the vineyard and the vintage. It can also be concluded that spontaneous alcoholic fermentation reduced the influence of the vintage on the wine composition, while the opposite was the case with cluster thinning.},

In this article, applications of several analytical techniques such as {DNA}-based techniques, spectrometric techniques, spectroscopic techniques, chromatographic techniques, lateral flow immunoassays, and neutron and proton based nuclear analytical techniques for forensic food analysis have been discussed. These sophisticated techniques are capable to analyze the food samples rapidly and permit the identification of specific parameters which are useful for investigations of food frauds in various legal issues. These techniques also pave-the-way, to discover the answers to many important analytical questions relating to food authentication and traceability in the field of food forensics. In addition, forensic analysis of dyes in food, seafood, plant-based food, beverages, and forensic analysis of postmortem viscera are reviewed.},

In total, 237 rice samples were analyzed in this study to examine origin and variety assessment and sourced from producing countries (Italy, Spain, Vietnam, Pakistan and Thailand). The Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model ({GP}-{LVM}) was applied as technique to obtain a meaningful compressed representation of the data in a two-dimensional space followed by a classification with a nearest neighbour algorithm. What concerns the origin assessment, {GC}-{MS} results score good across all countries, resulting in the most accurate method, with prediction rates ranging from 86\% to 94\%. Data fusion experiments of combination of {GC}-{MS} with {NIR}, or {GC}-{MS} with {HSI} resulted in prediction rates on origin assessment of more than 90\%. Variety assessment was performed with these analytical techniques. Using single techniques, {HSI} achieved prediction values above 90\% for all classes (96\%–99\%). For data fusion experiments of variety assessment combining {GC}-{MS} and {NIR} all prediction values were equal or higher than 92\%; for {GC}-{MS} combined with {HSI}, prediction values were all 98\%.

	abstract = {Food fraud is a pressing global challenge with far-reaching implications, necessitating robust preventive measures. The safeguarding of consumers from hazardous products, the preservation of supply chain integrity, and the assurance of fair competition all rely on effective anti-fraud strategies. Intelligent packaging technologies are pivotal in reducing food fraud through anti-tampering measures and traceability. However, standalone intelligent packaging technologies cannot alone establish comprehensive traceability within the food chain. This review asserts that integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence ({AI}) technologies can bolster traceability and combat food fraud. Blockchain enhances transparency, while {AI} enables precise analysis of extensive datasets. This comprehensive review critically examines the potential of combining blockchain and {AI} technologies with intelligent packaging to address food fraud. It thoroughly delineates the strengths and limitations of these technologies in detecting and mitigating fraud across the supply chain. The amalgamation of diverse technologies within intelligent packaging presents a holistic approach to mitigating significant fraud, contingent upon the effective resolution of technical, cost, and safety challenges. In conclusion, integrating sophisticated technologies into intelligent packaging offers a promising avenue to effectively combat food fraud, instill consumer trust, and maintain the integrity of the food supply chain.},

	abstract = {The impact of climate change on grapevine cultivation has led to challenges in winemaking, particularly in terms of elevated sugar levels and reduced acidity in grapes. To address this, the specie of Lachancea thermotolerans ({LT}) with high lactic acid production potential have gained attention. This study explores the co-fermentation of the selected {LT} with Saccharomyces cerevisiae {CECA} to improve the chemical and flavor profiles of wine. Four different inoculation timings were tested in Cabernet Sauvignon fermentation to investigate the effects on metabolic pathways and fermentation performances. The results indicated that indigenous L. thermotolerans A38 slightly prolonged the fermentation time (13–14 days) but produced wine with lower volatile acidity compared to the pure inoculations of S. cerevisiae {CECA} (12 days). In contrast, co-fermentation with L. thermotolerans A38 led to the higher acidity and altered the metabolic profile of the wine, including increased lactic acid production (1.38–3.02 g/L), especially when S. cerevisiae was inoculated 48 h after {LT} fermentation (3.02 g/L). In cofermented wines with {LT} strain, the levels of several aromatic volatiles, including phenylethyl alcohol (increasing by 4.10–37.64 \%), phenylethyl acetate (by 6.72–302.19 \%), ethyl lactate (by 4.48 folds), and ethyl acetate (by 2.65–83.07 \%), were significantly increased, along with some terpenes. Metabolomics analysis revealed that different inoculation timings significantly influenced the microbial biosynthesis pathways of flavonoids and amino acids, thereby altering the production of aromatic compounds. This study provides new insights into the role of L. thermotolerans in winemaking and presents an effective strategy for addressing the acidity issues associated with climate change-induced grape composition changes.},

Of 62 monitored elements that were quantified with fully validated methods, 24 and 32 elements differed significantly across the neighborhoods and vintages, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05). Targeted canonical variate analysis ({CVA}) explained 85\%-90\% of the variance ratio across the two vintages, indicating persistent and stable elemental fingerprints of wines at a sub-regional level.

The aim of this study was to analyze phenolic compounds in red monovarietal wines produced from Zweigelt (Vitis vinifera) and Rondo (non-Vitis vinifera) varieties while using the {UPLC}-{PDA}-{MS}/{MS} method and to assess whether these wines can be classified according to grape variety that is based on chemometric analysis. Fifty-five phenolic compounds belonging to five classes—anthocyanins, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, phenolic acids, and stilbenes—were identified and quantified in Zweigelt and Rondo wines. The wines of the Zweigelt variety were characterized by lower concentrations of phenolic compounds than those of the Rondo variety. Furthermore, wines of the Zweigelt variety contained the highest concentrations of flavan-3-ols, and wines of the Rondo variety—the highest concentrations of anthocyanins. Hierarchical cluster analysis ({HCA}) revealed that Zweigelt wines and Rondo wines formed two separate groups. The Rondo group was divided into two subgroups, differing in type of malolactic fermentation (spontaneous or induced). Phenolic compounds analysis by means of {UPLC}-{PDA}-{MS}/{MS} combined with {HCA} is a useful tool for the classification of red wines that were produced from Zweigelt and Rondo grape varieties, regardless of yeast strain and type of malolactic fermentation.},

Although X-ray ﬂuorescence ({XRF}) techniques oﬀer many advantages, they have been rarely used for wine analysis. Here, we show the comparison of wine elemental composition results obtained by total reﬂection X-ray ﬂuorescence ({TXRF}) and energy dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence ({EDXRF}) for elements K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Br, Rb, and Sr. The results obtained by {TXRF} and {EDXRF} have been additionally veriﬁed by inductively coupled plasma−mass spectrometry. The important analytical features of {XRF} techniques in wine science have been described, the preservation of volatile elements (e.g., Br) being one of their main advantages. In addition, we have shown that {XRF} techniques oﬀer an optimal analytical approach for building large data sets containing highly reliable and reproducible results of elemental abundances in wines, corresponding soils, and grape juice. Such data sets are especially important for the geographic authentication of wine. This has been shown for 37 Austrian and Croatian wines collected together with respective soils from selected wine regions. The element abundances in soil reﬂect in a large portion in grape juice and ﬁnished wine suggesting that the contribution of the soil, that is, the plant uptake capacity expressed as ci(wine)/ci(soil) concentration factors, can be a highly discriminating factor for wine ﬁngerprinting. This indeed has been proved in the present study in comparison to discrimination based only on wine element abundances. We have identiﬁed Fe, Zn, Br, Rb, and Sr as the best discriminator elements for the geographical authentication of wine. The study opens a new perspective in extending the application of {XRF} techniques as a costeﬀective analytical tool for creating large databases of soil, grape juice, and wine element abundances for the evaluation of soil characteristics and other environmental parameters on wine composition.},

	abstract = {Identifying grape varieties in wine, related products, and raw materials is of great interest for enology and to ensure its authenticity. However, these matrices’ complexity and low {DNA} content make this analysis particularly challenging. Integrating {DNA} analysis with 2D materials, such as graphene, offers an advantageous pathway toward ultrasensitive {DNA} detection. Here, we show that monolayer graphene provides an optimal test bed for nucleic acid detection with single-base resolution. Graphene’s ultrathinness creates a large surface area with quantum confinement in the perpendicular direction that, upon functionalization, provides multiple sites for {DNA} immobilization and efficient detection. Its highly conjugated electronic structure, high carrier mobility, zeroenergy band gap with the associated gating effect, and chemical inertness explain graphene’s superior performance. For the first time, we present a {DNA}-based analytic tool for grapevine varietal discrimination using an integrated portable biosensor based on a monolayer graphene field-effect transistor array. The system comprises a wafer-scale fabricated graphene chip operated under liquid gating and connected to a miniaturized electronic readout. The platform can distinguish closely related grapevine varieties, thanks to specific {DNA} probes immobilized on the sensor, demonstrating high specificity even for discriminating single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which is hard to achieve with a classical endpoint polymerase chain reaction or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The sensor was operated in ultralow {DNA} concentrations, with a dynamic range of 1 {aM} to 0.1 {nM} and an attomolar detection limit of ∼0.19 {aM}. The reported biosensor provides a promising way toward developing decentralized analytical tools for tracking wine authenticity at different points of the food value chain, enabling data transmission and contributing to the digitalization of the agro−food industry.},

The main aim of the research was the analysis of scientific and methodological approaches to the extraction of residual amounts of nucleic acids in wine raw materials and {DNA} authentication of wines for their subsequent application in solving the problem of determining wine products authenticity and place of origin. The prior art includes various approaches to the extraction of Vitis vinifera L. nucleic acids among which the three methods by Savazzini \& Martinelli, Pereira and Bigliazzi can be named basically. Analysis of the effectiveness of different methods of {DNA} extraction from wines indicates the superiority of the Pereira method over other traditional methods of extraction in terms of {DNA} yield and quality. Besides, the nucleic acid extracted from wines is characterized as residual since its concentration is significantly reduced in a multi-stage wine production process. The yield of extracted nucleic acid also decreases as the wine ages. The use of microsatellite {DNA} loci designed for grapes genetic identification is one of the approaches applicable for wine {DNA} authentication.},

	abstract = {Wines with a clear geographical origin are more attractive for customers. The geographical origin of wine is stated on its label, but no official standards guarantee its reliability. The present research objective was to analyze the existing methodological approaches to wine authentication. 
The study featured domestic and foreign publications indexed in Dimensions and Elibrary in 2017–2022 with such keywords as wine authentication, geographical origin of wine, and chemometrics. 
The research revealed no single methodological solution to wine authentication because food science knows a wide range of parameters, methods, analytical equipment, and data processing models. Chemometric methods are reliable because they are able to process large arrays of analytical research results structured in a data bank using the so-called fingerprint principle. They involve 2–65 markers that are individual for each geographical region, country, zone, or terroir. Another promising method is the quantitative and qualitative nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ({qNMR}) of protons 1H and deuterium 2H(D) nuclei, as well as other elements (13C, 17O, 31P, 14N). The review resulted in an integrated approach based on a combination of isotopic testing with cation-anionic profiling. The analytical support involved the methods of atomic absorption and atomic emission spectroscopy, spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma, isotope ratio mass-spectrometry, and quantitative and qualitative nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This combined approach could provide background for an all-Russian state standard with a single algorithm for wine authentication tests.  
The new approach will be used to develop enochemical profiles of wines from a particular region, as well as to choose the most effective chemometric models for geographical authentication.},

Until recently, fingerprinting approaches using liquid chromatography applications have been regarded as an effective tool for the assessment of wines employing polyphenol profiles. These profiles are of considerable importance for grapes and wines as they influence greatly the color, sensory, and nutritional quality of the final product. The authenticity and typicity characters are fundamental characteristics, which may be evaluated by the use of polyphenol fingerprinting techniques. Under these conditions, the evolution of polyphenols during the red wine elaboration and maturation processes shows a high importance at the level of the obtained fingerprints. Moreover, the environment factors (vintage, the area of origin, and variety) and the technological conditions significantly influence wine authenticity through the use of polyphenol profiles. Taking into account the complexity of the matter at hand, this review outlines the latest trends in the polyphenol fingerprinting of red wines in association with the transformations that occur during winemaking and storage.},

After noise reduction and ion peak alignments on the mass spectra, about 14 000 different signals were detected. The use of an in-house mass spectrometry database allowed us to assign 72 molecules. Then, a genetic algorithm was applied on two series of samples (learning and validation sets), each composed of 30 commercial wines from three different wine producing regions of France. Excellent results were obtained with only four diagnostic peaks and two ion ratios. This new approach could be applied to other aspects of wine production but also to other metabolomics studies.},

              There are two officially approved methods for stable isotope analysis for wine authentication. One describes δ
              18
              O measurements of the wine water using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry ({IRMS}), and the other one uses Deuterium-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (
              2
              H-{NMR}) to measure the deuterium of the wine ethanol. Recently, off-axis integrated cavity output (laser) spectroscopy ({OA}-{ICOS}) has become an easier alternative to quantify wine water isotopes, thanks to the spectral contaminant identifier ({SCI}). We utilized an {OA}-{ICOS} analyser with {SCI} to measure the δ
              18
              O and δ
              2
              H of water in 27 wine samples without any pre-treatment. The {OA}-{ICOS} results reveal a wealth of information about the growth conditions of the wines, which shows the advantages to extend the official δ
              18
              O wine water method by δ
              2
              H that is obtained easily from {OA}-{ICOS}. We also performed high-temperature pyrolysis and chromium reduction combined with {IRMS} measurements to illustrate the “whole wine” isotope ratios. The δ
              18
              O results of {OA}-{ICOS} and {IRMS} show non-significant differences, but the δ
              2
              H results of both methods differ much more. As the δ
              2
              H difference between these two methods is mainly caused by ethanol, we investigated the possibility to deduce deuterium of wine ethanol from this difference. The results present large uncertainties and deviate from the obtained
              2
              H-{NMR} results. The deviation is caused by the other constituents in the wine, and the uncertainty is due to the limited precision of the {SCI}-based correction, which need to improve to obtain the

              H values of ethanol as alternative for the

              The purpose of this paper is to identify and assess the factors that consumers evaluate significant in the assessment of food authenticity and guide them to make safe food choices.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              In this respect, a mixture model for consumer preferences, namely {CUB}, was employed due to the ability of discriminate features that are rated similarly allowing the detection of significant similarities and differences in consumers’ judgments. Moreover, introducing covariates in {CUB} models allow studying the influence that consumers’ socio-demographic characteristics have on the importance of the attributes used in the assessment of food authenticity.
            
            
              Findings
              The results demonstrate that organic certificate, traditional and homemade production practices, origin certificate as well as information about product’s origin country and raw materials production region are significant quality cues enable consumers to judge food authenticity. In addition, consumers further segmentation according to socio-demographic characteristics indicate that country of origin information are mainly used by middle-aged consumers, highly educated and paid, whereas production techniques and organic certification constitute the most effective indicators for judging food authenticity by older consumers.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The paper confirms that consumers can use extrinsic and intrinsic quality cues to judge food’s authenticity.},

The authors address the resulting conceptual ambiguity by reconceptualizing authenticity, defining it as a holistic consumer assessment determined by six component judgments (accuracy, connectedness, integrity, legitimacy, originality, and proficiency) whereby the role of each component can change according to the consumption context. This definition emerges from a two-stage, multimethod concept reconstruction process leveraging data from more than 3,000 consumers across no fewer than 17 types of consumption experiences. In stage one, the authors take a qualitative approach employing both in-depth interviews and surveys (one conducted on a nationally representative sample) to identify authenticity’s six constituent components. The final components are based on themes emerging from consumer data that were integrated and reconciled with existing definitions in the literature. In stage two, quantitative analyses empirically estimate the six components and support the composite formative nature of the construct. The authors document how certain components contribute to assessments of authenticity differently across contexts; in addition, they show that authenticity has consumer-relevant downstream consequences while being conceptually distinct from consumer attitudes. Their findings offer practitioners direction regarding what to emphasize to convey authenticity to consumers.},

Hence, the use of two complementary techniques, e.g., {LC}/{MS} and 1H-{NMR}, might be advantageous. Another possible advantage from using two different techniques is the ability to verify the results (for instance, by verifying a time trend of a metabolic pattern). In this work, both {LC}/{MS} and 1H-{NMR} data from analysis of rat urine have been used to obtain metabolic fingerprints. A comparison of three different methods for data fusion of the two data sets was performed and the possibilities and difficulties associated with data fusion were discussed. When comparing concatenated data, full hierarchical modeling, and batch modeling, the first two approaches were found to be the most successful. Different types of block scaling and variable scaling were evaluated and the optimal scaling for each case was found by cross validation. Validations of the final models were performed by means of an external test set.22Copies of the Matlab program files used for this work are available from the authors. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {One of the most important issues in the wine sector and prevention of adulterations of wines are discrimination of grape varieties, geographical origin of wine, and year of vintage. In this experimental research study, {UV}-Vis and {FT}-{IR} spectroscopic screening analytical approaches together with chemometric pattern recognition techniques were applied and compared in addressing two wine authentication problems: discrimination of (i) varietal and (ii) year of vintage of red wines produced in the same oenological region. {UV}-Vis and {FT}-{IR} spectra of red wines were registered for all the samples and the principal features related to chemical composition of the samples were identiﬁed. Furthermore, for the discrimination and classiﬁcation of red wines a multivariate data analysis was developed. Spectral {UV}-Vis and {FT}-{IR} data were reduced to a small number of principal components ({PCs}) using principal component analysis ({PCA}) and then partial least squares discriminant analysis ({PLS}-{DA}) and linear discriminant analysis ({LDA}) were performed in order to develop qualitative classiﬁcation and regression models. The ﬁrst three {PCs} used to build the models explained 89\% of the total variance in the case of {UV}-Vis data and 98\% of the total variance for {FR}-{IR} data. {PLS}-{DA} results show that acceptable linear regression ﬁts were observed for the varietal classiﬁcation of wines based on {FT}-{IR} data. According to the obtained {LDA} classiﬁcation rates, it can be aﬃrmed that {UV}-Vis spectroscopy works better than {FT}-{IR} spectroscopy for the discrimination of red wines according to the grape variety, while classiﬁcation of wines according to year of vintage was better for the {LDA} based {FT}-{IR} data model. A clear discrimination of aged wines (over six years) was observed. The proposed methodologies can be used as accessible tools for the wine identity assurance without the need for costly and laborious chemical analysis, which makes them more accessible to many laboratories.},

	abstract = {The chemical composition of grape wines varies with grape variety, environmental factors of climate and soil, and bacterial strains, which can each affect the wine quality. Using 1H {NMR} analysis coupled with multivariate statistical data sets, we investigated the effects of grape vintage on metabolic proﬁles of wine and the relationship between wine metabolites and meteorological data. Principal component analysis ({PCA}) showed a clear differentiation between Meoru wines that were viniﬁed with the same yeast strain and Meoru grapes harvested from the same vineyard but with a different vintage. The metabolites contributing to the differentiation were identiﬁed as 2,3-butandiol, lactic acid, alanine, proline, -aminobutyric acid ({GABA}), choline, and polyphenols, by complementary {PCA} loading plot. Markedly higher levels of proline, lactic acid and polyphenols were observed in the 2006 vintage wines compared to those of 2007 vintage, showing excellent agreement with the meteorological data that the sun-exposed time and rainfall in 2006 were approximately two times more and four times less, respectively, than those in 2007. These results revealed the important role of climate during ripening period in the chemical compositions of the grape. This study highlights the reliability of {NMR}-based metabolomic data by integration with meteorological data in characterizing wine or grape.},

This paper addresses frequently asked questions regarding terminology in connection with {NTMs}. The widespread development and adoption of these methods also necessitate the need to develop innovative approaches for {NTM} validation, i.e., evaluating the performance characteristics of a method to determine if it is fit-for-purpose.

	abstract = {For the wine industry, ensuring quality and authenticity hinges on the precise determination of wine origin. In our study, we developed a fast semi-quantitative method to analyse 41 chemical elements in wine, employing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ({ICP}-{MS}). This methodology characterises what we term the mineral wine profile ({MWP}). In contrast to an organic molecular profile, the mineral composition of a wine remains constant from the moment it is bottled. Mineral elements play a crucial role in the terroir of wine: they pass primarily from soil to grape and are then influenced by various vinification techniques. Indeed, it is widely recognised that the original soil characteristics are altered by a multitude of winemaking procedures, presenting a considerable challenge when endeavouring to extract origin-related information in a typical scenario. Our study demonstrates that statistical analyses and artificial intelligence ({AI}) could be a tool for accurately deciphering origin information within the {MWP}, provided sufficient mineral elements are measured and a comprehensive database of wine samples is employed to establish effective learning. In this study, a dataset comprising 12,966 {MWPs} was created in just over a year. The first analysis revealed correlations between the elements in wine, especially between rare earth elements, between macronutrients and between micronutrients. A machine learning method was then developed to assess wine origin and principal grape variety. Six models were tested by comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}), with {eXtreme} Gradient Boosting as the chosen model. Mean accuracies of 92 \% for country classification, 91 \% for the French wine region, and 85 \% for the main grape variety were obtained, and mean {AUC} scores of 0.964 for country classification, 0.961 for the French wine region and 0.914 for the main grape variety. This study represents the first comprehensive investigation at this scale on wine samples, and underscores the importance of using a comprehensive {MWP} dataset for {AI} applications when verifying wine origin. The authentication of a wine with over 99 \% specificity could be routinely achievable through this approach.},

Electroanalytical techniques have emerged as promising tools for detecting food adulteration due to their high sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability to field conditions. This review delves into the application of these techniques across various food matrices, including olive oil, honey, milk, alcoholic beverages, fruit juices, and coffee. By leveraging methodologies such as voltammetry and chemometric data processing, significant advancements have been achieved in identifying both specific and non-specific adulterants. This review highlights novel electrodes, such as carbonbased electrodes modified with nanoparticles, metal oxides, and organic substrates, which enhance sensitivity and selectivity. Additionally, electronic tongues employing multivariate analysis have shown promise in distinguishing authentic products from adulterated ones. The integration of machine learning and miniaturization offers potential for on-site testing, making these techniques accessible to non-experts. Despite challenges such as matrix complexity and the need for robust validation, electroanalytical methods represent a transformative approach to food authentication.

The simplest form of wine fraud involves fixing counterfeit labels of expensive wines to bottles of less expensive wine. However, timeconsuming analytical techniques requiring liquid sampling are mainly used for authentication purposes, which irremediably degrade the value of the bottle. This work aims to develop a new diagnostic tool based on the direct analysis of label matrix and ink in order to obtain valuable information that would enable a preliminary nondestructive authentication. Raman and infrared spectroscopies have been applied for fast, reproducible and discernible molecular characterization since both analytical techniques are strictly non-invasive and do not require sample preparation. They were successfully applied to a selected number of genuine and counterfeited bottles (Pauillac, France) and a series of bottles which goes from 1969 to 2010 belonging to the same producer (Pomerol, France). Raman spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy showed a great complementarity to clarify the molecular composition of label and inks. As a general overview, pigments are not useful for discrimination purpose in the pairs of original and counterfeited samples. However, several mismatch in label composition were identified, allowing the differentiation among samples. With respect to the second batch of bottles, Raman spectroscopy was able to trace the materials used in labels and inks, giving evidences about the chronologic order of manufacture. Despite the limited number of samples, mainly due to their uniqueness, the classification power of the proposed methodology has been clearly proven.},

A targeted metabolomics methodology was developed, including the determination and quantiﬁcation of 28 phenolic compounds from different classes (hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, stilbenes and ﬂavonoids). Moreover, 86 compounds were detected and tentatively identiﬁed via a robust suspect screening workﬂow using an in-house database of 420 wine related compounds.

Extension of the procedure by deep reinforcement learning resulted in an exquisite neural network predictive model for the classification of sparkling wines according to their geographical origin. A network trained on half of the sample set was able to classify even 94\% of all samples. The model can particularly be useful in cases where the number of samples is limited and when simpler statistical methods fail to produce reliable data. The model can further be exploited for the identification and differentiation of sparkling wines including a high potential for authenticity or quality control.},

	abstract = {The use of data fusion methodologies has increased at the same rhythm as the capability of modern analytical laboratories of measuring sample from multiple sources. Almost all data fusion strategies can be grouped into three levels, they fuse the data differently with the sole aim of obtaining a better response (qualitative or quantitative) than that obtained by the instruments individually. One of the major key points for the data fusion methodologies to succeed is the understanding of the data structure obtained from a particular instrument. This point is not exhaustively commented in the literature focused on data fusion, sometimes paying too much attention to the algorithms instead. This manuscript explains data fusion from the structure of the different data obtained by different analytical platforms. Special attention will be given to the nature of the data and the relationships between the samples and the variables, as well as within the variables.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              – This article aims to empirically test the terroir concept and tackles the issues of origin, typicity and legality. Whilst this has previously been examined at a theoretical level, the research uses a study of producer and consumer perceptions to examine the multidimensional nature of terroir and its relationship with authenticity.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              – A preliminary list of terroir items was aggregated from the literature and placed in an online questionnaire that was distributed to an industry sample and then to a consumer panel in France. Quality perceptions, anticipated satisfaction and purchase intent of terroir products were also included. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses were conducted, as were linear regressions between uncovered dimensions and the dependent variables.
            
            
              Findings
              – The results show that the terroir concept comprises three dimensions that relate to authenticity: product, internalised and institutional authenticity. All three dimensions are positively correlated. Each of these dimensions can be related to satisfaction, quality perceptions and purchase intent, although the intensity and valence will depend on the relationship of the respondent to wine.
            
            
              Originality/value
              – Prior to this research, there were no empirical results to support the multidimensional nature of terroir. As well, the distinct relationship between terroir and types of authenticity is defined.},

Third a comparative study between a nonsupervised Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}), supervised standard partial ({PLS}-{DA}), and sparse ({sPLS}-{DA}) least squares discriminant analysis, as well as orthogonal projections to a latent structures discriminant analysis ({OPLS}-{DA}), for obtaining holistic fingerprints. The {MSA} discriminated between different Cabernet Sauvignon fermentation schemes and juice varieties (apple, apricot, and orange) or juice authentications (puree, nectar, concentrated, and commercial juice fruit drinks). The new pulse sequence {DPFGE} demonstrated an enhanced sensitivity in the aromatic zone of wine samples, allowing a better application of different unsupervised and supervised multivariate statistical analysis approaches.},

Due to their constantly increasing demand and high value, fruit juice and wine are one of the most frequent targets of adulteration. Since adulterated foods are proven to have harmful effects on health, several approaches have been utilized for the detection of fruit juice and wine adulteration. Based on the requirement for sample destruction, analytical techniques to assess food authenticity can be classiﬁed into 2 main categories, i.e., destructive and non-destructive techniques. This paper provides an overview on the principle of adulteration detection, its application and performance, and the advantages and limitations of various analytical techniques. Destructive approaches, such as physicochemical methods, isotope analysis, elemental analysis, chromatographic techniques, and {DNA}-based techniques, are reviewed. Furthermore, non-destructive approaches, including spectroscopic-based techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic technique, electronic techniques, and imaging-based techniques, are discussed.},

Results demonstrated not only that grape {DNA} loss is produced by the fermentation process but also that clariﬁcation and stabilization operations contribute to the reduction of double-stranded {DNA} content on wine. Despite the presence of inhibitors, downstream {PCR} genotyping yielded reliable nuclear and chloroplast {SSR} markers for must samples, whereas no ampliﬁcation or inconsistent results were obtained at later stages of the viniﬁcation. In addition, a {TaqMan} genotyping assay based on cultivar-speciﬁc single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) was designed, which allowed assessment of grapevine {DNA} mixtures.

The idea of geographical authenticity and quality has increased as one of the most important parameters influencing consumers’ preferences. Chemical parameters such as total polyphenolic content ({TPC}), alcohol and organic acid content (total acids, malic and tartaric acids), and antioxidant activity were observed in this work at 15 dry white wines of varieties Pinot blanc, Riesling, Sauvignon blanc, and Chardonnay, which originated from three different countries. {FTIR} and spectrophotometry methods ({TPC} and {DPPH}) were used and chemometric approaches such as {ANOVA} and {PCA} were selected as the most important for evaluation. In general, high levels of malic acid, {TPC}, and antioxidant activity were detected in Austrian wines. Pinot blanc, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon from the same producing region in Austria showed higher results. The higher overall acid concentration was a distinguishing feature of the Slovakian Sauvignon and Riesling varieties, particularly in the case of tartaric acid. Austrian samples showed significantly higher antioxidant activity compared to Hungarian Chardonnay (p = 0.002) and Sauvignon (p = 0.007), comparable to {TPC}. The application of statistical analysis was useful in demonstrating many discrepancies, particularly by application of the {PCA} method.},

	abstract = {Background. The geographical authenticity of wine, often referred to as terroir, is crucial in determining its unique characteristics and quality. Terroir encompasses the environmental factors where the grapes are grown, including soil composition, climate, and topography. These factors influence the flavor, aroma, and overall profile of the wine, giving it characteristics that are unique to its region of origin. Establishing geographical authenticity helps protect wine heritage, ensures quality control, and enhances market value. This study analyzed the phenolic, volatile, and elemental composition of wines with original certification ({WOC}) from the Modré Hory region ({MH}) and compared them with wines from other Morava wine regions. Materials and methods. The study analyzed 24 wines of the ‘Frankovka’ variety from the Morava wine region, with 12 of these wines originating from the {MH} region with {WOC} certification. The researchers used Solid-Phase Microextraction coupled with Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy, and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry techniques for the analysis.
Results. Phenolic analysis revealed that {MHWOC} wines had significantly lower resveratrol levels, likely because of lower rainfall in the {MH} region. Volatile compound analysis reliably identified 38 substances, with {MHWOC} wines showing significant differences in the levels of ethyl octanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, and ethyl butyrate, attributed to unique production practices. Elemental analysis indicated higher Mg concentrations in {MHWOC} wines which were related to the region’s clay and loess soils, whereas other wines from the Morava wine region exhibited higher levels of Sc, Ti, Fe, K, V, and Y due to different soil compositions.
Conclusion. This study highlights the influence of regional soil and climate on wine composition and the potential of these parameters for the geographical authentication of wine. Based on the analysis, principal component analysis ({PCA}) reliably distinguished {MHWOC} wines from other wines originating from the Morava wine region, thereby confirming their unique characteristics.},

Ten diﬀerent red wines (Vitis vinifera) from Piedmont region were analysed 3 months after bottling and after a further 48 month conservation in a climate controlled wine cellar kept at a constant/controlled temperature of 12 °C. Two white wines (Vitis vinifera) were included in this study for comparison purposes. White wines were analysed 3 months after bottling and after further 24 months of bottle aging in the same climate controlled wine cellar. Metabolite changes during this period were evaluated using 1H {NMR} spectroscopy combined with statistical analysis. Metabolite variations due to wine aging were minimal compared to those that resulted from a diﬀerent wine type and wine geographical origin. Therefore, it was necessary to remove this source of variability to discriminate between fresh and reﬁned samples. The storage at low and controlled temperature for 2 or 4 years permitted a slow but progressive evolution of all wines under investigation. 1H {NMR} spectroscopy, implemented with statistical data analysis, allowed identifying and diﬀerentiating wine samples from the two aging stages. In most wines, a decrease in organic acids (lactic acid, succinic acid and tartaric acid) and an increase in esters (ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate) was observed. Catechin and epicatechin decreased during aging in all wines while gallic acid increased in almost all red wines.},

The study confirms that, just as for the berries, useful varietal authenticity markers for red wine, even after aging, turn out to be hydroxycinnamic acids, relative amounts of acylated forms of anthocyanins, and shikimic acid, together with some grape glycosidic precursors from terpenes and C13− norisoprenoids.

The aim of the work is to authenticate by geographical origin according to the data of the {ICP}-spectrometric and chemometric analysis of elemental "images" of wines produced from white grape varieties Chardonnay, Riesling and Muscat grown in four regions of the Krasnodar Territory, Russia. The difference in the contents of Al, Ba, Ca and Rb in wines was found depending on the variety, and Al, Ba, Rb, Fe, Li, Sr – depending on the region of grape growth. Different models of the experimental data processing were used for attribution of the produced varieties of wine to the area of the grape’s growth. The criterion for the quality of the constructed models was the accuracy of the attribution of a wine variety to the area of the grape’s growth (\%). Analysis of the elemental analysis data of 153 wine samples showed that in terms of attribution accuracy, automated neural networks (100 \%) are preferred among machine learning methods, followed by support vector machines (98.69 \%) and general discriminant analysis (94.77 \%). The applied mathematical models enabled the revealing of the cluster structure of the analyzed wine varieties and their attribution to the area of a grape growth with high accuracy. Sr, Li and Fe concentrations in wines were found as the dominating predictors in the constructed models for definition of the geographical origin of wines. The combination of {ICP}-spectrometric analysis data with the capabilities of statistical modeling of machine learning methods focused on large-dimensional data made it possible to successfully solve small-dimensional problems of the definition of the geographical origin of wines by their elemental composition and variety.},

Nevertheless, the notion of typicity is blurred for consumers and needs to be objectiﬁed for communication purposes. This study aims at formalizing a methodology for studying typicity of terroirs, with {PDO} wines as an example, using a participatory approach with professionals of the wine sector from terroirs, using focus group and tasting. The vision of typicity of terroirs by professionals outside of these terroirs has been studied by a free word association task.
{RESULTS}: This study allowed a clear distinguishing of the typicity of the studied terroirs. Professionals from terroirs identiﬁed the global conceptual typicity of their terroirs using various factors, mainly soil, geography and grape variety, whereas professionals outside terroirs expressed their visions of terroirs by reputation or sensory characteristics of wines. Tasting results showed a discrimination of wines based on their typicity and highlighted descriptors involved in sensory perceptual typicity for each studied terroir.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Professionals from terroirs share a common vision of their typicity and identify more typicity factors than professionals outside terroirs. Sensory typicity has been highlighted for ﬁve of the six terroirs studied, according to the various descriptors. The study of two populations, from and outside terroirs, shows the gap between the typicities identiﬁed by professionals from terroirs and those perceived by professionals outside terroirs.},

Monovarietal wines (2018 vintage) were evaluated by a trained sensory panel using the frequency of attribute citation methodology, and volatile compounds were identified and quantified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Agiorgitiko wines commonly exhibited a blackberry aroma as part of their overall aromatic profile and were also characterized by dried fruit (prune, fig), floral and grassy notes. Xinomavro wines were primarily characterized by tomato paste aroma, the most frequently cited attribute. Additionally, they exhibited olive, floral, fruity and spicy aromas. In Xinomavro wines, higher concentrations of terpenes and (E)-3-hexen-1-ol correlated with strawberry, tomato and olive aromas. In Agiorgitiko wines, β-damascenone, β-ionone and ethyl butyrate were associated with blackberry and dried fruit notes, while (Z)-3hexen-1-ol related to herbaceous and earthy notes. This study contributes to the understanding of aroma typicity in red wines from indigenous Greek grape varieties, which can support informed decisions in viticulture and winemaking to better align wine profiles with consumer preferences.},

	abstract = {Wine is one of the most counterfeit product and therefore, requires certifying of its origin and provenance. For authentication purposes, analytical strategies for the determination of Sr and Pb isotopic ratios were adapted for Champagne and sparkling wines. All analytical steps have been carefully adapted and optimized regarding sample preparation, mineralization, and purification by resins as well as isotopic composition measurements on 3 different {MC} {ICP}-{MS} instruments. Further, a global approach using an “in-house” reference material of Champagne ({ChRM}) was realized and used throughout as well as routine analytical conditions to guaranty samples isotopic quality determination over 3 years. These developments allowed to select the best conditions at all steps for reaching the best precision and accuracy to be used under routine conditions for samples origin discrimination. The best condition of mineralization was obtained with a hot block system allowing both efficiency in digestion and high sample throughput. Detailed conditions of purification for both Sr and Pb isotopes were also optimized and discussed. These different optimization steps on the whole analytical chain allowed to estimate a global precision suitable to be used routinely to discriminate the origin of different Champagne samples. For Sr isotopic analysis (87Sr/86Sr), the overall external precision based on preparation replicates of {ChRM} was 2σ = 0.000024 (n = 36) and for the Pb isotopes analysis (208Pb/206Pb), the precision obtained on {ChRM} was 2σ = 0.0024 (n = 15). Finally, we have applied these developments by combining both Sr and Pb isotopic ratios in order to discriminate the origin of sparkling wines from around the world. The combined isotopic signature, using both Sr and Pb isotopes ratios, permitted a clear discrimination between certified Champagne wines and other European and Non-European sparkling wines.},

The Amynteo and Naoussa regions are included in the protected designation of origin ({PDO}) zones where differences in terroir are evident. These differences occur due to several factors, such as soil conditions of the cultivated vineyards, temperature, altitude, and climatic variations. Herein, 22 Xinomavro wines from Amynteo and Naoussa, produced with an identical vinification procedure are analyzed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography–trapped ion mobility spectrometry–quadrupole time of flight–mass spectrometry ({UHPLC}–{TIMS}–{QTOF}–{MS}) with reverse phase chromatography and negative ionization mode. The aim is to evaluate the impact of the geographical origin on their phenolic profile. Both target and non‐target screening workflows are employed, leading to the identification and quantification of 26 phenolic compounds and the determination of 25 geographical origin biomarkers. Compounds like catechin and hydroxytyrosol are more abundant in samples from Naoussa while Amynteo is characterized by increased concentration of resveratrol and polydatin.

	abstract = {Background: Alcoholic beverages have been popular for thousands of years due to their unique ﬂavors and cultural signiﬁcance. However, the industry’s high proﬁt margins have led to increasingly sophisticated counterfeiting practices. Stable isotope analysis has emerged as one of the most promising techniques for addressing authenticity and traceability challenges in alcoholic beverages. Scope and approach: This review presents a comprehensive summary of the principles and recent advancements in the application of stable isotope techniques for authenticity assessment. It examines their use in detecting fraud (e.g., identifying edible alcohol, exogenous water, carbonylation, and trace compounds), vintage identiﬁcation, and geographical origin determination across various alcoholic beverages, with a particular focus on wine, Chinese baijiu, and beer. Conclusions: Stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool for verifying the authenticity of alcoholic beverages, offering effective solutions to combat counterfeiting, mislabeling, and adulteration. Future studies should focus on understanding the ecological, biological, and hydrometeorological factors inﬂuencing isotope signatures and develop advanced multiisotope and chemometric approaches to improve reliability. Expanding global databases and integrating emerging technologies such as artiﬁcial intelligence ({AI}) and machine learning will further enhance the effectiveness and accessibility of stable isotope techniques, ensuring safer and higher-quality alcoholic beverages for consumers worldwide.},

	abstract = {The Eurasian grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is one of the most extensively cultivated horticultural crop worldwide, with significant economic relevance, particularly in wine production. Accurate grapevine variety identification is essential for ensuring product authenticity, quality control, and regulatory compliance. Traditional identification methods have inherent limitations limitations; ampelography is subjective and dependent on skilled experts, while molecular analysis is costly and time-consuming. To address these challenges, recent research has focused on applying deep learning ({DL}) and machine learning ({ML}) techniques for grapevine variety identification. This study systematically analyses 37 recent studies that employed {DL} and {ML} models for this purpose. The objective is to provide a detailed analysis of classification pipelines, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach. Most studies use {DL} models trained on leaf images captured in controlled environments at distances of up to 1.2 m. However, these studies often fail to address practical challenges, such as the inclusion of a broader range of grapevine varieties, using data directly acquired in the vineyards, and the evaluation of models under adverse conditions. This review also suggests potential directions for advancing research in this field.},

Very few studies have dealt with a detailed quantitative analysis of stilbenes in wine. Most methodologies reported until now have been restricted to the analysis of few stilbenes such as resveratrol and piceid. In this study, a method for the quantiﬁcation of wine stilbenes has been developed and validated. The method was simple, fast and sensitive with {LOD} between 4 and 28 μg/L. Matrix eﬀects were assessed, and the methodology was validated in terms of precision, accuracy, linearity and repetitiveness. The method was able to quantify, in less than 5 min, ﬁfteen targeted stilbenes in wines including seven monomers, three dimers, one trimer, and four tetramers. The methodology was applied to white and red wines. E-piceid was the main stilbene in white wine (mean 155 μg/L). In red wine, Z- and E-piceid (mean 3.73 and 3.16 mg/L, respectively) were predominant. Additionally, large amount of other stilbenes including oligomers such as hopeaphenol (mean 1.55 mg/L) were found in red wines. The developed methodology could be useful to reveal diﬀerences in the contents of stilbenes in wine depending on variety, season, terroir, treatments, among others and potentially be used as a quality wine marker.},

	abstract = {Wine is an experiential product, with sensory characteristics playing a key role in its appreciation. Various chemical constituents, including non-volatile, semi-volatile and volatile compounds, contribute to its sensory profile. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H {NMR}) metabolomics to assess the aroma profile and structure of white wines. Metabolites such as acetate and glycerol were positively correlated with wine body and the perception of caramelised (acetate: R = 0.48, q {\textless} 0.001; glycerol: R = 0.48, q {\textless} 0.001) and dried and candied fruits (acetate: R = 0.49, q {\textless} 0.001; glycerol: R = 0.48, q {\textless} 0.001). The dried and candied fruits attribute was associated also with glucose (R = 0.41, q {\textless} 0.001) and fructose (R = 0.46, q {\textless} 0.001), while tropical fruits notes were linked to proline (R = 0.42, q {\textless} 0.001) and acetate (R = 0.41, q {\textless} 0.001). Although acetate and glycerol levels were independent of grape variety, the concentrations of proline, glucose, and fructose exhibited variety-dependent differences. 1H {NMR} metabolomics, though less complex than panels or volatile compound analysis, can uncover specific aroma-related features and maximise the information extracted from a single spectrum. Already applied in wine quality and authenticity assessments, this approach may support winemakers in estimating sensory profiles, offering a valuable tool for monitoring wine production and characterisation.},

	abstract = {In this study, 1H-{NMR} spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics was applied to study the wine metabolome and to classify wines according to different grape varieties and different terroirs. By obtaining the metabolomic fingerprinting and profiling of the wines, it was possible to assess the metabolic biomarkers leading the classification (i.e., phenolic compounds, aroma compounds, amino acids, and organic acids). Moreover, information about the influence of the soil in shaping wine metabolome was obtained. For instance, the relationship between the soil texture and the content of amino acids and organic acids in wines was highlighted. The analysis conducted in this study allowed extraction of relevant spectral information not only from the most populated and concentrated spectral areas (e.g., aliphatic and carbinolic areas), but also from crowded spectral areas held by lowly concentrated compounds (i.e., polyphenols). This may be due to a successful combination between the parameters used for data reduction, preprocessing and elaboration. The metabolomic fingerprinting also allowed exploration of the H-bonds network inside the wines, which affects both gustatory and olfactory perceptions, by modulating the way how solutes interact with the human sensory receptors. These findings may have important implications in the context of food traceability and quality control, providing information about the chemical composition and biomolecular markers from a holistic point of view.},

	abstract = {Aims: Differences in wine flavour proceed primarily from grape quality. Environmental factors (climate, soil), cultivars and training systems modify many grape and wine quality traits. Metabolic profiling based on proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-{NMR}) spectra has been proved to be useful to study multifactorial effects of the vine environment on intricate grape quality traits. The capacity of this method to discriminate the environmental effects on wine has to be demonstrated. Methods and results: : 1H-{NMR} spectra were made from wines produced with grapes harvested at maturity of three cultivars (Cabernet-Sauvignon, Cabernet franc and Merlot) and three soil types (gravely, sandy and clayey) during two vintages (2002 and 2003). Data were analysed by multivariate statistical methods. Principal component analysis applied on the {NMR} spectra data were not always able to separate satisfactorily wines from the 3 soil types. Conversely, partial least square analysis separated clearly the 3 soil types independently of the vintage and cultivar. Conclusion: By comparing the {NMR} signals that contribute to the two first axes of the {PCA} and {PLS} analyses, a significant soil effect on {NMR} signals in wines is reported. However, the effect of the vintage on wine composition was greater then the effect of the soil type. Significance and impact of study: After validation on a larger number of wine samples this chemical profiling will be a useful new method to the qualify wines in relation to climate, soil, and cultivar effects which contribute to the terroir.},

This study aims to provide an overview of the cases of food fraud focused on specific food groups - (fish and seafood, oils and fats, fruit and vegetables, honey and sugar, meat and meat products, wine, alcohol, milk and dairy products, spices and herbs, grain-based food – cereals - bakery products, eggs, snacks, coffee, tea, cocoa, non-alcoholic beverages, dietic foods supplements, fortified food). The data on food fraud was divided based on world continents (Asia, Africa, South America, North- Central America, Australia, and Europe). The next part of our overview shows the count of food fraud incidents separately each month for 2023. Overall, 419 cases were registered worldwide in 66 countries in 2023. Most cases were registered in Europe, South America, Africa, North-Central America, and Australia. Based on our findings, we can conclude that the highest number of cases were registered in Pakistan, followed by Italy, Brazil, Nigeria, the Dominican Republic, and Australia. The most abundant was alcohol-beverages adulteration (18.13 \% of the total number of cases reported in 2023 worldwide), followed by meat and meat products (15.03 \%), fish and seafood (13.60 \%), and grain-based food, cereals, and bakery products (11.69 \%). Analysis of notification data showed that the most used type of fraud was grey market trading, mislabeling, document forgery, dilution/mixing, substitution, and unapproved enhancement.

The latter provided wine f ingerprinting by processing the entire spectra with multivariate statistical analysis. {NTA} also allowed investigation of the hydrogen bond network inside wines via the analysis of 1H {NMR} chemical shift dispersions. Results showed that the differences among wines were due not only to the concentrations of various analytes but also to the characteristics of the H-bond network where different solutes were involved. The H-bond network affects both gustatory and olfactory perceptions by modulating the way how solutes interact with the human sensorial receptors. Moreover, the aforementioned H-bond network is also related to the soil properties from which the grapes were taken. Therefore, the present study can be considered a good attempt to investigate terroir, i.e., the relationship between wine quality and soil characteristics.},

	abstract = {The increasing demand for natural foods and beverages, i.e. prepared by excluding synthetic chemicals along the whole production chain, has boosted the adoption of organic and biodynamic cultivation methods which are based on protocols avoiding use of synthetic pesticides. This trend is striking in viticulture, since wine production is largely shaped by the varying drinking attitudes of environment-friendly consumers. Using 1H {NMR}, the compositions of grape berries, collected at harvest in 2009 and 2011, in experimental plots cultivated either with biodynamic or organic methods, were compared. Although the analysis provides a comprehensive metabolic proﬁle of berries, the resulting distinctive pattern consists of a few molecules. Lower content of sugars, coumaric and caffeic acids, as well as higher amount of c-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}) were observed in biodynamic grapes. The 1H {NMR} foodomics approach evidenced a diverse fruit metabolome that could be associated to a different physiological response of plants to the agronomic environment.},

Therefore, we used Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled High-resolution Mass Spectrometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and chemometrics ({PCA} and {PLS}-{DA}) to evaluate the grape maturity and maceration time on chemical composition of wines from two harvest seasons. Moreover, we investigated how these experimental factors could affect their chemical stability. Grapes maturity showed to be the main effect. Overall, phenolic acids and short-chain organic acids were found to be at higher levels in wines produced with unripe grapes from February and shorter maceration time (p {\textless} 0.05). Proanthocyanidins and other flavonoids were increased in wines macerated for longer time using overripe grapes harvested in July.

In this paper the predictive performance of high-level data fusion is investigated.Partial least squares is used on each of the data sets and dummy variables representing the classes are used as response variables. Based on the estimated responses ŷj for data set j and class k, a Gaussian distribution p(gk{\textbar}ŷj) is fitted. A simulation study is performed that shows the theoretical performance of high-level data fusion for two classes and two data sets. Within group correlations of the predicted responses of the two models and differences between the predictive ability of each of the separate models and the fused models are studied.Results show that the error rate is always less than or equal to the best performing subset and can theoretically approach zero. Negative within group correlations always improve the predictive performance. However, if the data sets have a joint basis, as with metabolomics data, this is not likely to happen. For equally performing individual classifiers the best results are expected for small within group correlations. Fusion of a non-predictive classifier with a classifier that exhibits discriminative ability lead to increased predictive performance if the within group correlations are strong. An example with real life data shows the applicability of the simulation results. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

While several studies attested a special vulnerability of the fast growing wine business in China, reports on chemical analyses of commercial wine samples are rare. We examined 50 predominantly red wines with European labelling, which were purchased on the Chinese market, for fraud-relevant parameters. More than 20\% of the tested samples revealed anomalies in relation to the stable isotope ratios of D/H, 18O/16O and 13C/12C, contents of technical glycerol by-products or anthocyanin composition. These results strongly suggested watering of the wines, chaptalisation, glycerol addition or the use of non-Vitis anthocyanin sources, respectively. Some of these samples also showed suspicious spelling errors or other irregularities in the labelling, but the majority appeared genuine to the eye. Hence, this spot check demonstrates the importance of chemical authenticity analysis of market samples in order to detect fraudulent products. Moreover, we used the same sample set for an evaluation of the Chinese standard method for carbon stable isotope determination of wine ethanol in comparison to the current {OIV} (International Organisation of Vine and Wine) standard method. The results of a Bland-Altman analysis indicated that the methods can be applied interchangeably. As the two methods differ in their workflow and in the requested equipment, this might eventually enable more laboratories to perform 13C/12C analysis of wine and spirits.},

            This paper examines the economic impact of wine counterfeiting, with a focus on the Sassicaia scandal, publicized in 2020, regarding counterfeit 2015 vintage bottles of the iconic Super Tuscan wine. Wine fraud, documented since ancient Rome, has evolved alongside the industry, with key developments such as the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée system aiming to curb it. The paper briefly reviews three other significant modern cases of wine counterfeiting: the Hardy Rodenstock “Jefferson bottles” affair, the Brunello di Montalcino scandal, and Rudy Kurniawan’s counterfeit operation. It then shifts to a detailed analysis of the case of Sassicaia. We combine informal analysis using data plots and a formal difference-in-differences analysis to assess the market impact of the 2015 Sassicaia scandal. We find that, surprisingly, the scandal led to an increase in the price of authentic 2015 Sassicaia, perhaps driven by perceived rarity and media attention.},

Further techniques will verify the provenance claims made about a food product e.g. breed, variety etc. as well as techniques to identify original geographic location of food production. These consider wholeness, or not, of a food item and do not need to necessarily identify the actual adulterant. The conceptual framework developed in this research focuses on the process of predicting, detecting and reacting to economically and criminally motivated food adulteration.},

The Commission carried out a project between 2020 and 2022 to collect information on the new arrangements put in place by Member States to fight fraud in the agri-food chain. Based on this project, the Commission has published an overview report which focuses on eight Member States and how their competent authorities developed control arrangements and strategies to combat fraudulent practices. It presents the challenges, opportunities, and several good practice examples in relation to fraud related controls in the Member States. Furthermore, the Commission published in March 2023 a guidance document to support Member States in their efforts to combat fraud within the agri-food supply chain. It is particularly helpful, as it clearly outlines how to uniformly interpret and apply the respective {EU} laws in the context of fighting food fraud.

This paper involves the joint analysis of zeroth-, first- and second-order data measured on a particular environmental system. The main advantage of this methodology is the possibility of analyzing the relationships of the different order data provided by several analytical techniques. This approach enables to achieve new knowledge, in a way that would be not accessible if considering the information individually. Environmental monitoring databases usually generate large amount of data. Multivariate statistical techniques are necessary to process all this information and obtain a correct interpretation. The Ludueña Stream located in Argentina was chosen as the study system. Samples from different sites of the basin were taken periodically. Conductivity and {pH} (zeroth-order data) were fused with near-infrared ({NIR}) spectra of suspended particulate material (first-order data) and with fluorescence emission-excitation matrices of dissolved organic matter (second-order data). Different chemometric algorithms made it possible to extract and merge all the information in a new database, enabling its later analysis as a whole. This methodology allowed to successfully studying the behavior of dissolved organic matter together with suspended particulate material and other specific variables, showing links between them. Their distributions along the basin and their evolutions over time were possible to obtain. Therefore, a simpler interpretation to evaluate the system status was achieved. This model allowed differentiating the variables affected by anthropic activities from those with a natural origin.},

Under optimized conditions, the third-order hydrodynamic differential pulse voltammetric data were recorded and modeled by {MCR}-{ALS}, {PARAFAC}2, U-{PLS}/{RTL}, N-{PLS}-{RTL}, U-{PCA}/{RTL}, and {APARAFAC} to select the best algorithm for assisting the sensor with the aim of simultaneous determination of {LD}, {CD} and {BA} in the presence of {IC} as uncalibrated interference. Our results confirmed {MCR}-{ALS} showed the best performance to assist the sensor for the analysis of synthetic samples. The {TTMIPs}/{MWCNTs}-{IL}/{GCE} assisted by {MCR}-{ALS} was also successful in analysis of pharmaceuticals used as medications to the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and its performance was comparable with {HPLC}-{UV} as the refence method.},

	abstract = {This paper explains the multi-way decomposition method {PARAFAC} and its use in chemometrics. {PARAFAC} is a generalization of {PCA} to higher order arrays, but some of the characteristics of the method are quite different from the ordinary two-way case. There is no rotation problem in {PARAFAC}, and e.g., pure spectra can be recovered from multi-way spectral data. One cannot as in {PCA} estimate components successively as this will give a model with poorer fit, than if the simultaneous solution is estimated. Finally scaling and centering is not as straightforward in the multi-way case as in the two-way case. An important advantage of using multi-way methods instead of unfolding methods is that the estimated models are very simple in a mathematical sense, and therefore more robust and easier to interpret. All these aspects plus more are explained in this tutorial and an implementation in Matlab code is available, that contains most of the features explained in the text. Three examples show how {PARAFAC} can be used for specific problems. The applications include subjects as: Analysis of variance by {PARAFAC}, a five-way application of {PA}\&{WAC}, {PAFUFAC} with half the elements missing, {PARAFAC} constrained to positive solutions and {PARAFAC} for regression as in principal component regression.},

This study aims to classify raw stingless bee honeys by bee species origins as a potential classifier using the {NMR}-{LCMS}-based metabolomics approach. Raw stingless bee honeys were analysed and classified by bee species origins using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-{NMR}) spectroscopy and an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry ({UHPLC}-{QTOF} {MS}) in combination with chemometrics tools. The honey samples were able to be classified into three different groups based on the bee species origins of Heterotrigona itama, Geniotrigona thoracica, and Tetrigona apicalis. D-Fructofuranose (H. itama honey), β-D-Glucose, D-Xylose, α-D-Glucose (G. thoracica honey), and L-Lactic acid, Acetic acid, L-Alanine (T. apicalis honey) ident D-Fructofuranose identified via1H-{NMR} data and the diagnostic ions of {UHPLC}-{QTOF} {MS} were characterized as the discriminant metabolites or putative chemical markers. It could be suggested that the quality of honey in terms of originality and purity can be rapidly determined using the classification technique by bee species origins via the1H-{NMR}- and {UHPLC}-{QTOF} {MS}-based metabolomics approach.},

	abstract = {During the past decade metabolomics has emerged as one of the fastest developing branches of “-omics” technologies. Metabolomics involves documentation, identification, and quantification of metabolites through modern analytical platforms in various biological systems. Advanced analytical tools, such as gas chromatography–mass spectrometry ({GC}/{MS}), liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy ({LC}/{MS}), and non-destructive nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy, have facilitated metabolite profiling of complex biological matrices. Metabolomics, along with transcriptomics, has an influential role in discovering connections between genetic regulation, metabolite phenotyping and biomarkers identification. Comprehensive metabolite profiling allows integration of the summarized data towards manipulation of biosynthetic pathways, determination of nutritional quality markers, improvement in crop yield, selection of desired metabolites/genes, and their heritability in modern breeding. Along with that, metabolomics is invaluable in predicting the biological activity of medicinal plants, assisting the bioactivity-guided fractionation process and bioactive leads discovery, as well as serving as a tool for quality control and authentication of commercial plant-derived natural products. Metabolomic analysis of human biofluids is implemented in clinical practice to discriminate between physiological and pathological state in humans, to aid early disease biomarker discovery and predict individual response to drug therapy. Thus, metabolomics could be utilized to preserve human health by improving the nutritional quality of crops and accelerating plant-derived bioactive leads discovery through disease diagnostics, or through increasing the therapeutic efficacy of drugs via more personalized approach. Here, we attempt to explore the potential value of metabolite profiling comprising the above-mentioned applications of metabolomics in crop improvement, medicinal plants utilization, and, in the prognosis, diagnosis and management of complex diseases.},

	abstract = {Metabolomics is a young field of knowledge that arises linked to other omics such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. This discipline seeks to understand the performance of metabolites, identifying, quantifying them, and thus understanding its mechanism of action. This new branch of omics science shows high potential, due to its noninvasive character and its close relation with phenotype. Several techniques have been developed to study the metabolome of biological samples, fundamentally nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}), mass spectrometry ({MS}) and vibrational spectrometry ({VS}) or a combination of several techniques. These techniques are focused to separate, detect, characterize, and quantify metabolites, as well as elucidate their structures and their function on the metabolic pathways they are involved. However, due to the complexity of the metabolome, in most cases it is necessary to apply several of these techniques to understand completely the whole scenery. This review is aimed to offer a summary of the current knowledge of these analytical techniques for metabolomics and their application to different fields as environmental, food or health sciences. Each technique shows different advantages and drawbacks depending on their technical characteristics and limitations, some factors, such as the aim of the study or the nature of the biological sample will condition the choice. Regarding their applications, {NMR} has been employed specially to identify new compounds and elucidate structures. The use of {MS} has gained popularity because of its versatility, easiness to be coupled to separation techniques and its high sensitivity. Whereas {VS} is widely employed for in situ studies, due to its nondestructive character. Metabolomics applications in different science fields are growing each year, due to advances in analytical techniques and combination with other omics that allow to increase the comprehension of metabolic processes. Further development of analytical tools is necessary to continue exploiting all the possibilities of metabolomics.

	abstract = {Metabolomics is undergoing tremendous growth and is being employed to solve a diversity of biological problems from environmental issues to the identification of biomarkers for human diseases. Nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) and mass spectrometry ({MS}) are the analytical tools that are routinely, but separately, used to obtain metabolomics data sets due to their versatility, accessibility, and unique strengths. {NMR} requires minimal sample handling without the need for chromatography, is easily quantitative, and provides multiple means of metabolite identification, but is limited to detecting the most abundant metabolites (⩾1 μM). Conversely, mass spectrometry has the ability to measure metabolites at very low concentrations (femtomolar to attomolar) and has a higher resolution (∼103–104) and dynamic range (∼103–104), but quantitation is a challenge and sample complexity may limit metabolite detection because of ion suppression. Consequently, liquid chromatography ({LC}) or gas chromatography ({GC}) is commonly employed in conjunction with {MS}, but this may lead to other sources of error. As a result, {NMR} and mass spectrometry are highly complementary, and combining the two techniques is likely to improve the overall quality of a study and enhance the coverage of the metabolome. While the majority of metabolomic studies use a single analytical source, there is a growing appreciation of the inherent value of combining {NMR} and {MS} for metabolomics. An overview of the current state of utilizing both {NMR} and {MS} for metabolomics will be presented.},

	abstract = {Objectives Metabolomics is an emerging science based on diverse high throughput methods that are rapidly evolving to improve metabolic coverage of biological fluids and tissues. Technical progress has led researchers to combine several analytical methods without reporting the impact on metabolic coverage of such a strategy. The objective of our study was to develop and validate several analytical techniques (mass spectrometry coupled to gas or liquid chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance) for the metabolomic analysis of small muscle samples and evaluate the impact of combining methods for more exhaustive metabolite covering. Design and methods We evaluated the muscle metabolome from the same pool of mouse muscle samples after 2 metabolite extraction protocols. Four analytical methods were used: targeted flow injection analysis coupled with mass spectrometry ({FIA}-{MS}/{MS}), gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry ({GC}–{MS}), liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry ({LC}–{HRMS}), and nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) analysis. We evaluated the global variability of each compound i.e., analytical (from quality controls) and extraction variability (from muscle extracts). We determined the best extraction method and we reported the common and distinct metabolites identified based on the number and identity of the compounds detected with low analytical variability (variation coefficient {\textless} 30\%) for each method. Finally, we assessed the coverage of muscle metabolic pathways obtained. Results Methanol/chloroform/water and water/methanol were the best extraction solvent for muscle metabolome analysis by {NMR} and {MS}, respectively. We identified 38 metabolites by nuclear magnetic resonance, 37 by {FIA}-{MS}/{MS}, 18 by {GC}–{MS}, and 80 by {LC}–{HRMS}. The combination led us to identify a total of 132 metabolites with low variability partitioned into 58 metabolic pathways, such as amino acid, nitrogen, purine, and pyrimidine metabolism, and the citric acid cycle. This combination also showed that the contribution of {GC}–{MS} was low when used in combination with other mass spectrometry methods and nuclear magnetic resonance to explore muscle samples. Conclusion This study reports the validation of several analytical methods, based on nuclear magnetic resonance and several mass spectrometry methods, to explore the muscle metabolome from a small amount of tissue, comparable to that obtained during a clinical trial. The combination of several techniques may be relevant for the exploration of muscle metabolism, with acceptable analytical variability and overlap between methods However, the difficult and time-consuming data pre-processing, processing, and statistical analysis steps do not justify systematically combining analytical methods.},

	abstract = {Primary task of a recommender system is to improve user's experience by recommending relevant and interesting items to the users. To this effect, diversity in item suggestion is as important as the accuracy of recommendations. Existing literature aimed at improving diversity primarily suggests a 2-stage mechanism – an existing {CF} scheme for rating prediction, followed by a modified ranking strategy. This approach requires heuristic selection of parameters and ranking strategies. Also most works focus on diversity from either the user or system's perspective. In this work, we propose a single stage optimization based solution to achieve high diversity while maintaining requisite levels of accuracy. We propose to incorporate additional diversity enhancing constraints, in the matrix factorization model for collaborative filtering. However, unlike traditional {MF} scheme generating dense user and item latent factor matrices, our base {MF} model recovers a dense user and a sparse item latent factor matrix; based on a recent work. The idea is motivated by the fact that although a user will demonstrate some affinity towards all latent factors, an item will never possess all features; thereby yielding a sparse structure. We also propose an algorithm for our formulation. The superiority of our model over existing state of the art techniques is demonstrated by the results of experiments conducted on real world movie database.},

Direct trilinear decomposition {DTD} and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares {MCR}-{ALS} methods are two of the most representative three-way resolution procedures. The former, non-iterative, is based on the resolution of the generalized eigenvectorreigenvalue problem and the latter, iterative, is focused on the optimization of initial estimates by using data structure and chemical constraints. {DTD} and {MCR}-{ALS} have been tested on a variety of three-way simulated data sets having common sources of variation in real response profiles, such as signal shift, broadening or shape distortions caused by noise. The effect of these factors on the resolution results has been evaluated through the analysis of several parameters related to the recovery of both qualitative and quantitative information and to the quality of the overall data description. Conclusions inferred from the simulated examples help to clarify the performance of both methods on a real example and to provide some general guidelines to understand better the potential of each method. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the predictive modeling for such an integrated dataset faces two major challenges, namely, heterogeneity and imbalance in the acquired data. Thus, in this study, we present a method for the integration of multiple biological datasets called multimodal multitask matrix factorization ({MMMF}) to address these issues. The {MMMF} uses matrix factorization ({MF}) to integrate data from multiple heterogeneous biological datasets, and oversampling is applied to resolve the imbalanced data during the training step. Moreover, gradient surgery is used for multitask ({MF} and classification) learning to increase the quantity of classification information by projecting the gradients of the {MF} that conflict with the classification gradient onto the normal plane of a classification gradient. We demonstrate that {MMMF} outperforms other state-of-the-art biomedical classification models in binary and multi-class classification problems using five biological datasets. We also show that {MMMF} can be used as a feature selection approach for finding biomarkers that help in classification. The source code of the {MMMF} is available at https://github.com/{DMCB}-{GIST}/{MMMF}.},

Data sets measured using these methods provide partly complementary information, and their joint analysis has the potential to reveal underlying structures, which are, otherwise, difficult to extract. While we can collect vast amounts of data using different analytical methods, data fusion remains a challenging task, in particular, when the goal is to capture the underlying factors and use them for interpretation, e.g., for biomarker identification. Furthermore, many data fusion applications require joint analysis of heterogeneous (i.e., in the form of higher order tensors and matrices) data sets with shared/unshared factors. In order to jointly analyze such heterogeneous data sets, we formulate data fusion as a coupled matrix and tensor factorization ({CMTF}) problem, which has already proved useful in many data mining applications, and discuss its extension to a structure-revealing data fusion model, i.e., a data fusion model that can identify shared and unshared factors. The traditional methods commonly used for data fusion in the presence of shared/unshared factors are matrix factorization-based methods. Using both simulations and prototypical experimental coupled data sets, we assess the performance of various state-of-the-art data fusion methods and demonstrate that while matrix factorization-based approaches have limitations when used for joint analysis of heterogeneous data sets, the structure-revealing {CMTF} model can successfully capture the underlying factors by exploiting the low-rank structure of higher order data sets.},

	title = {{PARAFAC}: Parallel factor analysis},
	abstract = {We review the method of Parallel Factor Analysis, which simultaneously fits multiple two-way arrays or 'slices' of a three-way array in terms of a common set of factors with differing relative weights in each 'slice'. Mathematically, it is a straightforward generalization of the bilinear model of factor (or component) analysis (xij = X =,a,,bj,) to a trilinear model (xijk = C =Iai,bjrckr). Despite this simplicity, it has an important property not possessed by the two-way model: if the latent factors show adequately distinct patterns of three-way variation, the model is fully identified; the orientation of factors is uniquely determined by minimizing residual error, eliminating the need for a separate 'rotation' phase of analysis. The model can be used several ways. It can be directly fit to a three-way array of observations with (possibly incomplete) factorial structure, or it can be indirectly fit to the original observations by fitting a set of covariance matrices computed from the observations, with each matrix corresponding to a two-way subset of the data. Even more generally, one can simultaneously analyze covariance matrices computed from different samples, perhaps corresponding to different treatment groups, different kinds of cases, data from different studies, etc. To demonstrate the method we analyze data from an experiment on right vs. left cerebral hemispheric control of the hands during various tasks. The factors found appear to correspond to the causal influences manipulated in the experiment, revealing their patterns of influence in all three ways of the data. Several generalizations of the parallel factor analysis model are currently under development, including ones that combine parallel factors with Tucker-like factor 'interactions'. Of key importance is the need to increase the method's robustness against nonstationary factor structures and qualitative (nonproportional) factor change.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: The ability to determine the age of ginseng is very important because the price of ginseng depends on the cultivation period. Since morphological observation is subjective, a new scientific and systematic method for determining the age of ginseng is required. (2) Methods: Three techniques were used for a metabolomics approach. High-resolution magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance ({HR}-{MAS} {NMR}) spectroscopy was used to analyze powdered ginseng samples without extraction. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry ({UPLC}-{QTOF}/{MS}) and gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-fight mass spectrometry ({GC}-{TOF}/{MS}) were used to analyze the extracts of 4-, 5-, and 6-year-old ginseng. (3) Results: A metabolomics approach has the potential to discriminate the age of ginseng. Among the primary metabolites detected from {NMR} spectroscopy, the levels of fumarate and choline showed moderate prediction with an area under the curve ({AUC}) value of more than 0.7. As a result of {UPLC}-{QTOF}/{MS}-based profiling, 61 metabolites referring to the {VIP} (variable importance in the projection) score contributed to discriminating the age of ginseng. The results of {GC}×{GC}-{TOF}/{MS} showed clear discrimination of 4-, 5-, and 6-year-old ginseng using orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis ({OPLS}-{DA}) to 100\% of the discrimination rate. The results of receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) analysis, 16 metabolites between 4- and 5-year-old ginseng, and 18 metabolites between 5- and 6-year-old ginseng contributed to age discrimination in all regions. (4) Conclusions: These results showed that metabolic profiling and multivariate statistical analyses can distinguish the age of ginseng. Especially, it is meaningful that ginseng samples from different areas had the same metabolites for age discrimination. In future studies, it will be necessary to identify the unknown variables and to collaboratively study with other fields the biochemistry of aging in ginseng.},

While {GC}-{MS} of silylated and aroma compounds led to the identification of 74 and 16 compounds, respectively. Finally, {NMR}-based metabolite fingerprinting permitted the quantification of the major metabolites for future standardization. In parallel,in vivoantidiabetic potential of the baobab fruit using a streptozotocin ({STZ}) induced diabetic rat model was assessed.

A comparative {MS} and {NMR} metabolomics approach was employed to investigate the major primary and secondary metabolites composition of S. persica in context of its organ type viz., root or stem to rationalize for its use as a tooth brush. {NMR} metabolomics revealed its enrichment in nitrogenous compounds including proline-betaines i.e., 4-hydroxy-stachydrine and stachydrine reported for the first time in S. persica. {LC}/{MS} metabolomics identified flavonoids (8), benzylurea derivatives (5), butanediamides (3), phenolic acids (8) and 5 sulfur compounds, with 21 constituents reported for the first time in S. persica. Principal component analysis ({PCA}) and hierarchical cluster analysis ({HCA}) of either {NMR} or {LC}/{MS} dataset clearly separated stem from root specimens based on nitrogenous compounds abundance in roots and is justifying for its preference as toothbrush versus stems. The presence of betaines at high levels in S. persica (9−12 μg/mg dry weight) offers novel insights into its functioning as an osmoprotectant that maintains the hydration of oral mucosa. Additionally, the previously described anti-inflammatory activity of stachydrine along with the antimicrobial effects of sulfonated flavonoids, benzylisothiocynate and ellagic acid derivatives are likely contributors to S. persica oral hygiene health benefits. Among root samples, variation in sugars and organic acids levels were the main discriminatory criterion.

Likely, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}) enables the detection of aroma profile of foodstuff. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the influence of two different cold plasma processes (dielectric barrier discharge atmospheric plasma ({ACP}) and glow discharge plasma ({GP})), as well as the effect of different processing conditions on taste and aroma profiles from camu-camu juice. Both {ACP} and {GP} processing resulted in modifications on taste and aroma, which were strongly dependent of the frequency of plasma generation, flow rate, and treatment duration. The {GP} processing resulted in higher influence on camu-camu composition than {ACP}, which decreased the contents of important flavor compounds while increasing vitamin C and ethanol contents. Moreover, {GP} during 10 min at 10 {mL}/min and 20 min at 20 {mL}/min of plasma flow rate did not present significant effect on the juices composition as a whole (taste and aroma related compounds). The {ACP} processing presented significant influence on the juices composition at 420 and 530 Hz, while 200 and 960 Hz maintained the overall organic composition. Therefore, the use of {NMR} and {GC}-{MS} coupled to advanced chemometric analysis (data fusion) allowed a deep understand the camu-camu chemical variability submitted to plasma technologies based on taste and aroma compounds.

Several microorganisms such as fungi are well adapted to transform drug, whether at the stage of screening or for large-scale production. Objectives: Due to the high chemical complexity of the biotransformation media, it seems attractive to develop new analytical strategies in order to guarantee an adequate monitoring and optimize the production of targeted metabolites or drug candidates. Methods: The model designed for this purpose concerns the biotransformation of a potential histamine H3 antagonist (S38093) in order to produce phase I metabolites. {MS}, {NMR} and chemometrics tools were used to monitor biotransformation reactions. Results: First, a screening of eleven filamentous fungi was carried out by {UHPLC}–{UV}–{MS} and principal component analysis to select the best candidates. Subsequently, {MS} ({tR}, m/z) and {NMR} (1H, {JRES}) fingerprints associated with Consensus {OPLS}-{DA} multiblock approach were used to better understand the bioreaction mechanisms in terms of nutrient consumption and hydroxylated metabolites production. Then an experimental design was set up to optimize the production conditions ({pH}, kinetic) of these target metabolites. Conclusion: This study demonstrates how {NMR} and {MS} acquisitions combined with chemometric methods offer an innovative analytical strategy to have a grasp of functionalization mechanisms, and identify metabolites and other compounds (amino acids, nutrients, etc.) in complex biotransformation mixtures.},

Herein, large-scale multi-targeted metabolic profiling and fingerprinting techniques were utilized to help gain a broader insight into Passiflora species leaves' chemical composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ({NMR}) and mass spectrometry ({MS}) spectra of extracted components derived from 17 Passiflora accessions and from different geographical origins were analyzed using multivariate data analyses. A total of 78 metabolites were tentatively identified, that is, 20 C-flavonoids, 8 O-flavonoids, 21 C, O-flavonoids, 2 cyanogenic glycosides, and 23 fatty acid conjugates, of which several flavonoid conjugates are for the first time to be reported in Passiflora spp. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the most complete map for secondary metabolite distribution within that genus. Major signals in 1H-{NMR} and {MS} spectra contributing to species discrimination were assigned to those of C-flavonoids including isovitexin-2”-O-xyloside, luteolin-C-deoxyhexoside-O-hexoside, schaftoside, isovitexin, and isoorientin. P. incarnata was found most enriched in C-flavonoids, justifying its use as an official drug within that genus.

A metabolomic approach employing concatenated {LC}-{MS} and {NMR} data was utilised for the first time to study the relationships between environment and plant metabolism. A seasonal pattern was observed for the occurrence of metabolites that included sugars, sesquiterpenes lactones and phenolics in the leaf and stem parts, which can be correlated to the amount of rainfall and changes in temperature. The distribution of the metabolites in the inflorescence and root parts were mainly affected by variation of some soil nutrients such as Ca, Mg, P, K and Cu.

Here, we have attempted to combine two detection techniques, {LC}-{MS} and 1H {NMR} spectroscopy, to obtain a comprehensive metabolite profile of urine at 24 h following lethal (7.5 Gy) and sub-lethal (5 Gy) irradiation in mice. Integrated data analytics using multiblock-{OPLSDA} ({MB}-{OPLSDA}), correlation networking and pathway analysis was used to identify metabolic disturbances associated with radiation exposure. {MB}-{OPLSDA} revealed better clustering and separation of irradiated groups compared with controls without overfitting (p-value of {CV}-{ANOVA}: 1.5 × 10−3). Metabolites identified through {MB}-{OPLSDA}, namely, taurine, creatine, citrate and 2-oxoglutarate, were found to be dose independent markers and further support and validate our earlier findings as potential radiation injury biomarkers. Integrated analysis resulted in the enhanced coverage of metabolites and better correlation networking in energy, taurine, gut flora, l-carnitine and nucleotide metabolism observed post irradiation in urine. Our study thus emphasizes the major advantage of using the two detection techniques along with integrated analysis for better detection and comprehensive understanding of disturbed metabolites in biological pathways.},

	abstract = {Metabolomics, the science that describes a full range of small molecules in a sample at a time point, is a powerful tool to evaluate patterns in metabolite variations affected by environmental factors. We developed a multiblock metabolomics approach using {LC}-{HRMS}, {HS}-{SPME}-{GC}–{MS} and 1H {NMR} to study the interspecies and temporal metabolites variations of two red algae species from the genus Asparagopsis well-known for their broad range of biological activities. Samples were collected over two years at 5 sites. For each sample, a biphasic extraction was performed to allow distinct analyses of apolar phases by {LC}-{HRMS} and of polar phases by 1H {NMR}. The remaining lyophilized algal powder was analysed using a {HS}-{SPME}-{GC}–{MS} method. Temporal variation of antibacterial activities of extracts of the two algae was also studied and its potential covariation with algal metabolome was evaluated. On the one hand, the multiblock analysis allowed the interspecies and temporal discrimination of the two species, and putative identification of potential chemotaxonomic markers including highly halogenated molecules. Organosulfur compounds enriched in A. armata samples could be detected with both 1H {NMR} (taurine and isethionic acid) and {LC}-{HRMS} (sulfolipids). On the other hand, the variation in several metabolites intensities could be related to temporal effects, probably linked to environmental factors. It is the case of floridoside, a major carbohydrate, and citrulline (1H {NMR}) that both can have antioxidant properties, but also of various sulfolipids ({LC}-{HRMS}). The antibacterial activity of extracts of both species was constant throughout the year and did not covary with metabolome. This work is also the first to report the study of the metabolome of the two different species of the genus Asparagopsis by 1H {NMR} and {HS}-{SPME}-{GC}–{MS}.},

Because of their high added value, careful attention must be paid to ensure the oils' genuineness and authenticity. Characterising their chemical complexity in a holistic perspective constitutes a potent way to relate specific compounds to the organoleptic properties of interest and to assess their quality. In this context, a complete characterisation using untargeted metabolomics represents an analytical challenge. The present study takes advantage of multiblock data modelling to integrate heterogeneous signals collected from {GC}-{FID}, 1H-{NMR}, {UHPLC}-{TOF}/{MS}- (negative mode) and {UHPLC}-{TOF}/{MS}+ (positive mode) platforms to obtain a complete characterisation of 64 samples of cold pressed lemon oil ({CPLO}). Two statistical approaches ({MB}-{PLS}-{DA} and Consensus {OPLS}-{DA}) were used to classify the samples according to their extraction processes [i.e. Sfumatrice, Food Machinery Corporation Inline Extractor ({FMC}), Brown Oil Extractor ({BOE}), Pelatrice, or mixed {FMC}+Pelatrice]. Furthermore, the multiblock strategy allows links between variables from different analytical methods to be drawn easily and facilitates the identification of compounds. Because citrus oils extracted using the Sfumatrice process constitute the reference quality from an organoleptic point of view, these samples were characterised thoroughly and are reported to contain less fatty acids but more sesquiterpenes and furocoumarins compared with products obtained using other extraction processes.},

Since over-fitting is an issue when variable selection is involved, we implemented a cross model validation ({CMV}) to assess the reliability and stability of the selected variables. The performance of the method was evaluated using a simulated data set and a multi-block data set from a dietary intervention study with pigs used as model for humans. The objective of the study was to investigate the biochemical effects in plasma after dietary intervention with breads varying in types of dietary fiber and to identify potential biomarkers. By introducing Sparse {MBPLSR}, we aimed at identifying the biomarkers where data from {LC}–{MS} and {NMR} instruments were analyzed simultaneously and therefore in addition we intended to explore the relationships among the measurement variables of this multi-block data set.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the variability of the primary metabolites of phloem saps from 10 different species of pine by {NMR} spectroscopy, as well as the aroma compounds using {SPME}–{GC}–{MS}. Each technique provided a different set of metabolites that we can correlate to monkey predilection. The {PCA} showed monosaccharide (detected by {NMR}) and α-pinene (pine-like and resinous flavor descriptors) as attractive compounds for monkeys. On the other hand, the low content of monosaccharide and the high content of β-phellandrene (citrus odor descriptor) was observed in less attacked pine species (P. patula). The data fusion on primary metabolites and aroma compounds corroborated the individual analyses, complementing the comprehension of the monkey predilection. Thus, P. elliottii was an avoided tree even with high content of sugars possibly due to its high content of β-phellandrene (citrus odor). The results are useful for further behavioral studies to determine the role that each highlighted metabolite plays in chemically mediated animal-plant interactions.},

Fifty-six honey samples from four monofloral origins (acacia, orange blossom, lavender and eucalyptus) and multifloral sources from various geographical origins were analysed using the three instruments. The discriminating power of the results was examined by {PCA} first considering each technique separately, and then combining {NMR} and {LC}-{HRMS} together with or without variable selection. It was shown that the discriminating potential is increased through the data fusion, allowing for a better separation of eucalyptus, orange blossom and lavender.

	abstract = {Abstract: Metabolomics datasets are commonly acquired by either mass spectrometry ({MS}) or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ({NMR}), despite their fundamental complementarity. In fact, combining {MS} and {NMR} datasets greatly improves the coverage of the metabolome and enhances the accuracy of metabolite identification, providing a detailed and high-throughput analysis of metabolic changes due to disease, drug treatment, or a variety of other environmental stimuli. Ideally, a single metabolomics sample would be simultaneously used for both {MS} and {NMR} analyses, minimizing the potential for variability between the two datasets. This necessitates the optimization of sample preparation, data collection and data handling protocols to effectively integrate direct-infusion {MS} data with one-dimensional (1D) 1H {NMR} spectra. To achieve this goal, we report for the first time the optimization of (i) metabolomics sample preparation for dual analysis by {NMR} and {MS}, (ii) high throughput, positive-ion direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ({DI}-{ESI}–{MS}) for the analysis of complex metabolite mixtures, and (iii) data handling protocols to simultaneously analyze {DI}-{ESI}–{MS} and 1D 1H {NMR} spectral data using multiblock bilinear factorizations, namely multiblock principal component analysis ({MB}-{PCA}) and multiblock partial least squares ({MB}-{PLS}). Finally, we demonstrate the combined use of backscaled loadings, accurate mass measurements and tandem {MS} experiments to identify metabolites significantly contributing to class separation in {MB}-{PLS}-{DA} scores. We show that integration of {NMR} and {DI}-{ESI}–{MS} datasets yields a substantial improvement in the analysis of metabolome alterations induced by neurotoxin treatment.

Triterpenes and C-glycosyl flavones were the compounds that significantly contributed to differences observed between T. catappa plant samples harvested in autumn/winter and spring, respectively. The variations observed in the compound composition of the plant leaves may be related to processes induced by environmental stress and leaf development.

Multiblock methods can be applied to a wide range of data-driven problems that practitioners face nowadays such as plant-wide process monitoring and diagnosis, process optimization and quality prediction of key product properties. These methods have the ability to find associations and interpretative connections between different data blocks from different sources and carrying complementary or overlapping information, as well as assessing the blocks’ relative contributions to the final outcome. A critical stage in the application of multiblock methods is the selection of the appropriate preprocessing to apply to each block, before proceeding to the modelling. The preprocessing strategy can exponentiate the information extracted from the blocks and their mutual interactions or hide/mask/distort them if inappropriately done. In this article, we present a systematic workflow where both the intra-block and inter-block variation components are considered during preprocessing. We illustrate the application of the framework using two real case studies where a critical comparison is presented for the different preprocessing alternatives.},

The Brazilian Cerrado flora is characterized by a rich diversity of native plant species, and a number of these plant species have been found to have suitable medicinal properties. Some of these plant species include Byrsonima intermedia and Serjania marginata. To better understand the chemical composition of these plant species, we conducted a study using the state-of-the-art techniques including the {HPLC} system coupled to an Exactive-Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization interface {UHPLC}-({ESI})-{HRMS} and by {NMR} being performed 2D J-resolved and proton {NMR} spectroscopy. For the analysis, samples were harvested bimonthly during two consecutive years. {UHPLC}-({ESI})-{HRMS} data were preprocessed and the output data uploaded into an in-house Excel macro for peak dereplication. {MS} and {NMR} data were concatenated using the data fusion method and submitted to multivariate statistical analysis. The dereplication of {LC}-{HRMS} data helped in the annotation of the major compounds present in the extracts of the three plant species investigated allowing the annotation of 68 compounds in the extracts of B. intermedia (cinnamic acids, phenolic acids derived from galloyl quinic and shikimic acid, proanthocyanidins, glycosylated flavonoids, triterpenes and other phenols) and 81 compounds in the extracts of S. marginata (phenolic acids, saponins, proanthocyanidins, glycosylated flavonoids among other compounds). For a better assessment of the great number of responses, the significance of the chemical variables for the differentiation and correlation of the seasons was determined using the variable importance on projection ({VIP}) technique and through the application of the false discovery rate ({FDR}) estimation. The statistical data obtained showed that seasonal factors played an important role on the production of metabolites in each plant species. Temperature conditions, drought and solar radiation were found to be the main factors that affected the variability of phenolic compounds in each species.},

Current metabolomic technologies go well beyond the scope of standard clinical chemistry techniques and are capable of precise analyses of hundreds to thousands of metabolites.

Principal component analysis ({PCA}) was employed to assess the overall clustering of samples, whereas supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis ({OPLS}-{DA}) was effectively used for discrimination purposes. {OPLS}-{DA} models were fully validated (R2Y and Q2 values {\textgreater} 0.5) and the variable importance in projection ({VIP}) approach was employed to provide valuable data about differential metabolites with high discrimination potential (8 markers were putatively identified). For origin differentiation, three markers were highlighted with {VIP} values {\textgreater} 1.5 (i.e. reynosin, artabsinolide D, and tatridin B). Fatty acid derivates were the most frequent markers within the metabolites annotated for processing discrimination (e.g. 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid and 9-hydroperoxy-10E-octadecenoic acid). Additionally, different combinations of mid-level data fusion of chromatographic-mass spectrometric techniques ({UHPLC} and gas chromatography coupled to {HRMS}) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H {NMR}) were evaluated for the first time for geographical and processing discrimination of black pepper. The {NMR}-{UHPLC}-{GC} mid-level fused model was preferred among the tested fusion approaches since good sample clustering and no misclassification were achieved. Enhanced correct classification rate was achieved by mid-level data fusion compared with the findings obtained for one of the individual techniques (1H {NMR} fingerprinting) (from 92\% to 100\% of samples correctly classified). This study opens the path to new metabolomics approaches for black pepper authentication and quality control.},

Its findings are applicable to producers of fruit, quality vegetables, processed meats and dairy products such as yoghurt and cheese, or beverages such as local whiskeys, beers and ciders.When these farmers invest in special food and beverages that have a local character and back-story,they can move up the value chain and closer to consumers.

            As worldwide consumer demand for high‐quality products and for information about these products increases, labels and geographical indications ({GIs}) can serve to signal quality traits to consumers; however, {GI} systems among countries are not homogeneous and can be used as trade barriers against competition. Philosophical differences between the European Union ({EU}) and the United States about how {GIs} should be registered and protected led to the formation of a World Trade Organization ({WTO}) dispute‐settlement panel. In this article, we discuss the issues behind the dispute, the {WTO} panel decision, and the {EU} response to the panel decision leading to the new Regulation 510/2006. Given the potential for {GI} labels to supply consumer information, context is provided for the discussion using recent literature on product labeling. Implications are drawn regarding the importance of the panel decision and the {EU} response relative to {GI} issues yet to be negotiated under the Doha Round.

A common form of {EMA}, undeclared substitution with alternative ingredients, is usually a health concern because of allergen labeling requirements. As demonstrated by the nearly 300,000 illnesses in China from melamine adulteration of infant formula, {EMA} also has the potential to result in serious public health consequences. Furthermore, {EMA} incidents reveal gaps in quality assurance testing methodologies that could be exploited for intentional harm. In contrast to foodborne disease outbreaks, {EMA} incidents present a particular challenge to the food industry and regulators because they are deliberate acts that are intended to evade detection. Large-scale {EMA} incidents have been described in the scientific literature, but smaller incidents have been documented only in media sources. We reviewed journal articles and media reports of {EMA} since 1980. We identified 137 unique incidents in 11 food categories: fish and seafood (24 incidents), dairy products (15), fruit juices (12), oils and fats (12), grain products (11), honey and other natural sweeteners (10), spices and extracts (8), wine and other alcoholic beverages (7), infant formula (5), plant-based proteins (5), and other food products (28). We identified common characteristics among the incidents that may help us better evaluate and reduce the risk of {EMA}. These characteristics reflect the ways in which existing regulatory systems or testing methodologies were inadequate for detecting {EMA} and how novel detection methods and other deterrence strategies can be deployed. Prevention and detection of {EMA} cannot depend on traditional food safety strategies. Comprehensive food protection, as outlined by the Food Safety Modernization Act, will require innovative methods for detecting {EMA} and for targeting crucial resources toward the riskiest food products.},

	abstract = {Innovation is essential for addressing the current challenges of the wine sector and ensuring its sustainable future. Law plays a pivotal role in fostering and disseminating innovation. At the same time, innovations can present legislators with significant challenges and cause legal disruption. This paper evaluates the innovativeness of European Wine Law in light of the ongoing sustainability transformation. The focus of {EU} regulations is wine quality and authenticity, mainly through the protection of Geographical Indications ({GIs}). In Regulation ({EU}) 2021/2117, the {EU} legislator recently introduced new rules on fungus-resistant grape varieties, de-alcoholised products, and digital labelling. We describe the effects of these rules on the respective innovation systems and assess how, vice versa, these innovations exert disruptive pressure on wine law. While the legal framework shows remarkable flexibility, a reconfiguration seems necessary at the level of {GIs}. The sustainability transformation implies an openness to innovation even for traditional producers. Regulatory Sandboxes in {GI} product specifications could allow for more experimentation without compromising heritage. A wine constitution could guide the transformation towards a more resilient and sustainable wine system.},

Olive oil, milk, honey, and saffron were the most common targets for adulteration reported in scholarly journals, and potentially harmful issues identiﬁed include spices diluted with lead chromate and lead tetraoxide, substitution of Chinese star anise with toxic Japanese star anise, and melamine adulteration of high protein content foods. High-performance liquid chromatography and infrared spectroscopy were the most common analytical detection procedures, and chemometrics data analysis was used in a large number of reports. Future expansion of this database will include additional publically available articles published before 1980 and in other languages, as well as data outside the public domain.

Increased wine purchases throughout China have given rise to persistent fraud where fake wines are packaged and sold with counterfeit contents and labels. For exporting countries like France, counterfeit wines displace market share, damage foreign brand reputation, and cause distrust in consumers who are aware of counterfeiting problems throughout the country. We examine the impact of fraudulent wine events (as measured by negative media reports) on Chinese wine demand diﬀerentiated by supplying country. We employ the Rotterdam demand system and a switching regression procedure to estimate import demand and compare results across diﬀerent media variable speciﬁcations. Results consistently show that negative reports disproportionately aﬀect French wine regardless of how the media variable is speciﬁed. This is not surprising because most fraudulent events involve French wine counterfeits.},

	abstract = {In applications of {NMR} to biological macromolecules in solution, the concentration of the {NMR} sample is an important parameter describing the sample and providing information for the selection and planning of experiments. Although concentrations can be measured directly by {NMR} spectroscopy, other methods are usually preferred to measure the concentration of macromolecules in {NMR} samples. The reasons are the difficulties in the correlation of the sample of interest with the signal intensity representing a known concentration. This correlation is usually obtained by adding to the sample a reference compound with known concentration and comparing the integral over resolved resonance lines of the molecules with known and unknown concentrations. For solutions of biological macromolecules it is very difficult to find a compound that does not interact with the macromolecules and has a resonance outside their spectral range. We introduce {PULCON} which is a method that correlates the absolute intensities of two spectra measured in different solution conditions. {PULCON} is easy to implement and apply on all {NMR} spectrometers; it does not need any special hardware or software. {PULCON} is very robust and at the same time delivers accurate concentrations of samples in the {NMR} tube. We demonstrate that {PULCON} has the potential to replace {UV} spectroscopy for concentration measurements of {NMR} samples.},

Besides wet chemistry, these include chromatography, isotopic ratio mass spectrometry, optical spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy, which have been applied in recent years in combination with chemometric approaches. For many years, 2H {NMR} spectroscopy was the method of choice and achieved official recognition in the detection of sugar addition to grape products. Recently, 1H {NMR} spectroscopy, a simpler and faster method (in terms of sample preparation), has gathered more and more attention in wine analysis, even if it still lacks official recognition. This technique makes targeted quantitative determination of wine ingredients and nontargeted detection of the metabolomic fingerprint of a wine sample possible. This review summarizes the possibilities and limitations of 1H {NMR} spectroscopy in analytical wine authentication, by reviewing its applications as reported in the literature. Examples of commercial and open-source solutions combining {NMR} spectroscopy and chemometrics are also examined herein, together with its opportunities of becoming an official method.},

Sugars such as glucose; acids such as malic, acetic, fumaric, and shikimic acids (the latter two as minor components); and sorbic acid, a preservative, were selected for the exemplary quantitative determination of substances in wine. Selection criteria for the examination of sample material included different {NMR} spectral signal types (singlet and multiplet), as well as the suitability of the proposed substances for manual integration at different levels of challenge (e.g., interference as a result of the necessary suppression of a water signal or the coverage of different typical wine concentration ranges for a selection of major components, minor components, and additives). To show that this method can be universally applied, {NMR} measurement and the method of evaluation were not strictly elucidated. Fifteen international laboratories participated in the collaborative trial and determined six parameters in 10 samples. The values, in particular the reproducibility {SD} ({SR}), were compared with the expected Horwitz {SD} ({SH}) by forming the quotient {SR}/{SH} (i.e., the {HorRat} value). The resulting {HorRat} values of most parameters were predominantly between 0.6 and 1.5, and thus of an acceptable range.},

	abstract = {Fourier transform 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy was suitable for the quantitative determination of polydimethylsiloxanes ({PDMS}) in wine and edible oil samples. This approach offers highly specific qualitative and quantitative analysis due to silicone-specific location of proton signals linked to carbon atoms located directly next to silicon atoms (0–0.5 ppm), as well as a different location of signals in the range for different organosilicon structures. The method can be used for the control of {PDMS} at regulatory limits in foodstuffs (10 mg kg-1) using hexamethyldisiloxane ({HDMS}) as an internal standard. Samples were prepared by extraction under suitable conditions to separate the analyte, and with analyte enrichment before 1H-{NMR} analysis. Analytical procedures were developed to permit the determination of {PDMS} at 0.06 mg kg-1 in wine and at 6 mg kg-1 in edible oils samples using readily available {NMR} instrumentation. It was, however, possible to lower the limit of detection to 6 μg kg-1 for wine and to 60 μg kg-1 for edible oils using a higher field instrument (500 {MHz}). Relative standard deviations (Sr) were obtained for wine (0.028) and for oil samples (0.043), which when compared with values obtained for samples spiked with {PDMS} (0.021) indicated that the sample preparation was the main factor determining the precision of the method. The average recovery rates for {PDMS} were 97 and 95\% for wine and edible oils, respectively. {PDMS} was detected in four brands of Italian wine, with Chianti-Rafaello containing the highest concentration (0.35 mg kg-1), and in four types of edible oils, highest concentration (11.9 mg kg-1) being found in Italian corn oil. None of the levels of {PDMS} found in the food samples exceeded the permissible standards laid down by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (10 mg kg-1), with the exception of the one corn oil sample.},

In the present study, quantitative 1H {NMR} metabolomics was applied to assess the composition of finished traditional method (bottle-fermented) sparkling wines aged for 18-months in cellar conditions (14 ◦C, 70\% relative humidity) following liqueur d′expedition (dosage) additions with six sugar types (glucose, fructose, sucrose derived from sugar beets and sugar cane, maltose, and {MCR} Sucraisin®) and a zero-dosage control. No systematic trends were observed when comparing the metabolite profile across sugar types, nor between the zero-dosage control and treatments with sugar additions. Multivariate statistical approaches using principal component analysis ({PCA}) and partial least squares discriminant analysis ({PLS}-{DA}) did not effectively discriminate between dosage treat­ ments nor wine age, while orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis ({OPLS}-{DA}) suc­ cessfully discriminated between wines by age and was validated through permutation tests.

	abstract = {The performance of three quantitative {NMR} methods was compared in terms of short‐term and long‐term precision and accuracy, robustness, linear range, and general applicability. The Internal Reference method employs a reference material co‐dissolved with sample; the External Reference method employs a reference material contained in a separate solution; and the third method, known as Electronic {REference} To access In vivo Concentrations ({ERETIC}), employs an externally calibrated digital reference peak. The Internal Reference method results were the most precise and remained stable within 0.1\% for at least 4 weeks. The results from the External Reference and {ERETIC} methods were practically equivalent to each other during this time. These methods exhibited small differences relative to the standard set by the Internal Reference method and slightly lower precision, establishing them as practical alternatives to the Internal Reference method. In contrast to the Internal Reference method, the External Reference and {ERETIC} methods possess several advantages that address peak overlap, flexibility of calibration, and duration of applicability. The study was designed such that each spectrum contained the information needed to compare the three methods while all other variables were kept constant. Applicability of pulse width compensation is addressed. {ERETIC} software compensation and minor adjustments to 90° pulse width were concluded to be unnecessary for this system. Although each of the methods was applied here to specifically calculate and compare chemical purity values, this evaluation applies generally to absolute quantitation by {NMR}.

These changes can alter its metabolomic ﬁngerprinting, impacting further classiﬁcation tasks and quality/quantitative analyses. For these reasons, the aim of this work is to compare and analyze the information obtained by different chemometric methods used in a complementary form ({PCA}, {ASCA}, and {PARAFAC}) to study 1H-{NMR} spectra variations of four red wine samples kept at different temperatures and time lapses. In conjunction, distinctive changes in the spectra are satisfactorily tracked with each chemometric method. The chemometric analyses reveal variations related to the wine sample, temperature, and time, as well as the interactions among these factors. Moreover, the magnitude and statistical signiﬁcance of the effects are satisfactorily accounted for by {ASCA}, while the time-related effects variations are encountered by {PARAFAC} modeling. Acetaldehyde, formic acid, polyphenols, carbohydrates, lactic acid, ethyl lactate, methanol, choline, succinic acid, proline, acetoin, acetic acid, 1,3-propanediol, isopentanol, and some amino acids are identiﬁed as some of the metabolites which present the most important variations.},

	abstract = {Quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance measurements have become more popular over the last decade. The introduction of new methods and experimental parameters has been of fundamental importance in the development of new applications. Amongst these new developments is the introduction of electronic referencing for quantifications. The use of electronic referencing eliminates errors in the analyses as a result of weighting of internal standards as well as undesired problems as a result of the solubility of the standards in the analyte solution and chemical interactions between the analyte and the internal standard.
            
              In this work, we have studied the quantification of a very important analyte in a food matrix, benzoic acid in orange juice, as a model to the validation and measurement uncertainty estimation of electronic referencing using
              1
              H {NMR} in food analyses. The referencing method applied was the pulse length‐based concentration measurement.
            
            Method was validated and showed good results for the precision and accuracy parameters evaluated. A certified reference material and a reference material candidate were analyzed, and extremely good results were obtained. Reported relative expanded uncertainties are in the 1.07–1.39\% range that can be considered an extremely good performance for the analysis of a food complex matrix. Measurement uncertainty was evaluated by two different approaches, and the pulse calibrations for the samples and for the reference have been shown to account for approximately 80\% of the total uncertainty of the measurement.

This state-of-the-art review covers the different analytical methodologies developed to ensure wine traceability from sample preparation to 1H-{NMR} spectrum analysis. The potential applications of 1H-{NMR} spectroscopy in oenology, from wine authenticity control to the monitoring of winemaking, are described.

In this article a newly developed method using nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy for the simultaneous determination of 15 substances relevant to assessing the quality and authenticity of spirit drinks is described. The new method starts with a simple and rapid sample preparation and does not need an internal standard. For each sample, a group of 1H-{NMR} spectra is recorded, among them a two-dimensional spectrum for analyte identiﬁcation and one-dimensional spectra with suppression of solvent signals for quantiﬁcation. Using the Pulse Length Based Concentration Determination ({PULCON}) method, concentrations are calculated from curve ﬁts of the characteristic signals for each analyte. The optimisation of the spectra, their evaluation and the transfer of the results are done fully automatically. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, acetic acid, citric acid, formic acid, ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, acetaldehyde, methanol, n-propanol, isobutanol, isopentanol, 2-phenylethanol and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural ({HMF}) can be quantiﬁed with an overall accuracy better than 8\%. This new {NMR}-based targeted quantiﬁcation method enables the simultaneous and eﬃcient quantiﬁcation of relevant spirit drinks ingredients in their typical concentration ranges in one process with good accuracy. It has proven to be a reliable method for all kinds of spirit drinks in routine food control.},

For the last 10 years, the use of quantitative1H {NMR} (q-{NMR}) for food authentication has experienced an enormous increase. This study was based on a comparative evaluation of the results obtained for three sets of authentic high-valued wines and suspected wines. Two methodologies have been followed: (i) the usual wine analysis, based on the utilization of multiple techniques, which is the traditional way of analysis for wine authentication and (ii) q-{NMR} profiling, the alternative proposed method. For wine comparison, an original approach based on similarity score (S-score) by analogy to the Z-score calculation was developed. A limit of four S-scores outside the range − 2/2 has been, arbitrary, defined to reveal that wines are different using q-{NMR} analysis. Data treatments allowed the extraction of discriminating parameters, some of which were common to both approaches while others could be linked to the techniques’ capabilities showing the complementarity of the two approaches. This study demonstrated the potential of q-{NMR} in wine authentication by comparative analysis with authentic samples. The q-{NMR} alternative method has also the advantages of rapidity (around 20 min including sample preparation, analysis, and data treatment) and low volume (0.5 {mL}), which is a prerequisite for analyzing priceless wines.},

A total of forty wine metabolites were quantified. Three different stages of maturity were studied (under-maturity, maturity and over-maturity). Enzyme treatments were carried out using two pectolytic enzymes (E1 and E2). Finally, two proteinaceous fining treatments were compared (vegetable protein, fining F1; pea protein and {PVPP}, fining F2). The results show a clear difference between the three stages of maturity, with an impact on different classes of metabolites including amino acids, organic acids, sugars, phenolic compounds, alcohols and esters. A clear separation between enzymes E1 and E2 was observed. Both fining agents had a significant effect on metabolite concentrations.

	abstract = {These days, the agri-food economy is focused on the consumer demands regarding safety, quality and security of food, and especially of wine products. Authenticity of wine has been extensively examined; wine is an easily adulterated product as it has high alcohol content and low {pH} and also is available worldwide. For these reasons, continuous controls are required to maintain the quality of wine. Usually, volatile compounds are used to characterize varieties, minerals are used for geographical differentiation, whereas amino acids as well as phenolic compounds evaluation are used for both. There is a necessity to be developed advanced techniques for wine authentication and this is the challenge for the researchers, who currently are given a special focus. Wine adulteration for both variety and origin has been very extensive. Therefore, apart from novel experimental techniques ({GC}-{MS}, {ICP}-{MS}, 13C {NMR} and {FT}-{IR} among others) multivariate analysis comprising principal component analysis ({PCA}), discriminant analysis ({DA}), canonical analysis ({CA}) and cluster analysis ({CLA}) are also used.
               Beer is a very common alcoholic beverage. Its authenticity has always received a lot attention of the scientific literature. This resulted in numerous studies focused on the classification of beers, according to different types, brands and factories, based on the determination of characteristic compounds or chemical, physical fingerprint in beers by various analytical instruments such as vibrational spectroscopy, fluorescence, mass spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance and so forth. In this review, the beer authenticity and traceability studies are categorized according to their objective, from less challenging to more challenging, the determination of type and brewing process, the determination of brand identity, the determination of origin and ultimately, the determination of the style of beer (craft vs. conventional).
               Beer authenticity is a multivariate problem that needs advanced numerical chemometrics. The literature review identified that the number of samples and the study design need to be improved, and the quality of the chemometrics methods needs to be elevated. More work needs to be done in getting the chemometric models out of the lab and into the real world, with academia and industry working closely in larger studies and big data. The areas that are still under investigation together with other proposals are also discussed thoroughly in this review.},

	abstract = {Background: Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) and Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis ({OPLS}-{DA}) are powerful statistical modeling tools that provide insights into separations between experimental groups based on high-dimensional spectral measurements from
{NMR}, {MS} or other analytical instrumentation. However, when used without validation, these tools may lead investigators to statistically unreliable conclusions. This danger is especially real for Partial Least Squares ({PLS}) and {OPLS}, which aggressively force separations between experimental
groups. As a result, {OPLS}-{DA} is often used as an alternative method when {PCA} fails to expose group separation, but this practice is highly dangerous. Without rigorous validation, {OPLS}-{DA} can easily yield statistically unreliable group separation. Methods: A Monte Carlo analysis of {PCA}
group separations and {OPLS}-{DA} cross-validation metrics was performed on {NMR} datasets with statistically significant separations in scores-space. A linearly increasing amount of Gaussian noise was added to each data matrix followed by the construction and validation of {PCA} and {OPLS}-{DA} models.
 Results: With increasing added noise, the {PCA} scores-space distance between groups rapidly decreased and the {OPLS}-{DA} cross-validation statistics simultaneously deteriorated. A decrease in correlation between the estimated loadings (added noise) and the true (original) loadings was also
observed. While the validity of the {OPLS}-{DA} model diminished with increasing added noise, the group separation in scoresspace remained basically unaffected. Conclusion: Supported by the results of Monte Carlo analyses of {PCA} group separations and {OPLS}-{DA} cross-validation metrics, we provide
practical guidelines and cross-validatory recommendations for reliable inference from {PCA} and {OPLS}-{DA} models.},

This work presented a new approach for wine analysis and provided more information concerning red wine ageing. {RESULTS}: This method could simultaneously quantitatively analyse 2 monosaccharides, 8 organic acids and 13 amino acids in wine. A validation experiment showed good linearity, sensitivity, reproducibility and recovery. Multiple derivatives of five amino acids have been found but their effects on quantitative analysis were negligible, except for methionine. The evolution pattern of each category was different, and we speculated that the corresponding mechanisms involving microorganism activities, physical interactions and chemical reactions had a great correlation with red wine flavours during ageing. {CONCLUSION}: Simultaneously quantitative analysis of monosaccharides, organic acids and amino acids in wine was feasible and reliable and this method has extensive application prospects. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {Wine maturation consists of wine being stored in vessels after alcoholic fermentation and malolactic fermentation and before bottling. This is a key period during the wine™ s evolution, with changes in the physicochemical and sensory characteristics, especially in the colour, aroma, flavour and mouthfeel. Traditionally, oak barrels have been the main vessel choice for the maturation period. However, due to new technology and increasing consumer interest, winemakers are now using different vessels which vary in material, shape and size to mature their wines. Despite this gain in popularity, there are key questions remaining regarding how exactly variations in maturation vessel physical parameters affect wine quality during maturation. This review summarises how variations to maturation vessel material, size, and shape influence wine quality, specifically regarding oxygen permeation, thermal conductivity, and the release of exogenous compounds. Overall, the vessel material and size have a significant influence over the oxygen transfer rate of the vessel, and the associated changes to colour, aroma and mouthfeel, which occur with oxygen ingress. Maturation vessels may be conceptually viewed on a scale of inertness™, with more inert vessels, such as stainless-steel tanks, generally having higher thermal conductivity, lower oxygen transfer rate and less release of exogenous compounds, with the opposite being true for the more active vessels such as oak barrels. Finally, this review points out gaps in the literature such as how maturation vessel parameters influence lees-wine interaction. This review aims to lay out paths for future research needed to shed light on how maturation vessel choice affects wine quality. © 2023 Instituto Nacional de Investigacao Agraria e das Pescas.

	abstract = {Respiratory diseases are multifactorial heterogeneous diseases that have proved recalcitrant to understanding using focused molecular techniques. This trend has led to the rise of 'omics approaches (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) and subsequent acquisition of large-scale datasets consisting of multiple variables. In 'omics technology-based investigations, discrepancies between the number of variables analyzed (e.g., {mRNA}, proteins, metabolites) and the number of study subjects constitutes a major statistical challenge. The application of traditional univariate statistical methods (e.g., t-test) to these "short-and-wide" datasets may result in high numbers of false positives, while the predominant approach of p-value correction to account for these high false positive rates (e.g., {FDR}, Bonferroni) are associated with significant losses in statistical power. In other words, the benefit in decreased false positives must be counterbalanced with a concomitant loss in true positives. As an alternative, multivariate statistical analysis ({MVA}) is increasingly being employed to cope with 'omics-based data structures. When properly applied, {MVA} approaches can be powerful tools for integration and interpretation of complex 'omics-based datasets towards the goal of identifying biomarkers and/or subphenotypes. However, {MVA} methods are also prone to over-interpretation and misuse. A common software used in biomedical research to perform {MVA}-based analyses is the {SIMCA} package, which includes multiple {MVA} methods. In this opinion piece, we propose guidelines for minimum reporting standards for a {SIMCA}-based workflow, in terms of data preprocessing (e.g., normalization, scaling) and model statistics (number of components, R 2, Q2, and {CV}-{ANOVA} p-value). Examples of these applications in recent {COPD} and asthma studies are provided.

The methanol content in wine that is stored in oak barrels was the lowest compared to that in other containers. The optimal conditions to control the methanol content in spine grape wine should be as follows: ferment wine with high-quality materials under 25–26°C for 3–6 d, with a pectinase of 15–20 mg/L and yeast added; and store the wine in oak barrels. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Fermentation technique had a significant effect on the concentrations of Mv-3-Glu, Peo-3-Glu and Cy-3-Glu, and their concentrations were found to be significantly higher in spontaneously fermented wines. Regarding colorless phenolic compounds, concentrations of (+) gallic acid and (+) catechin were 19\% and 26.8\% higher in spontaneously fermented {CS} wines compared to inoculated wines. After six months of bottle storage, the concentration of anthocyanins showed a significant decrease. The losses in monomeric anthocyanin contents were 52\% and 60\% in spontaneous and inoculated wines, respectively. Concentrations of Mv-3-Glu, Peo-3-Glu and Del-3-Glu decreased by 48.9–52.6\% in spontaneously fermented wines during 6 months of aging, while 56.7–63.2\% losses were observed in inoculated wines. Unlike anthocyanins, total phenol contents of wines obtained by both techniques increased notably after six months of storage. 52\% and 47.9\% increases were observed in the gallic acid concentration of spontaneous and inoculated wines, respectively.

Closures were microagglomerate corks, screw caps, and synthetics with the known oxygen transfer rate ({OTR}), ranging from 0.1 to 4.6 mg/y, including natural corks. Oxidation intensity perception, dissolved oxygen, sulfite, and 3-methyl-2,4-nonanedione ({MND}) were monitored on a regular basis. After 10 years of aging, additional aroma impact markers were evaluated (3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol, H2S, {DMS}, methional, and phenylacetaldehyde). Low {OTR} levels (≤0.3 mg/y) delayed the oxidation of red wines in this long-term experiment. In addition, our results led us to hypothesize that the {MND} concentration in young wines might be linked with their ability to produce it during bottle aging that is with their aging potential. Finally, we found that the kinetic accumulation of {MND} in wines was first strongly impacted by its intrinsic composition and thereafter by the {OTRT}0 of the stopper. © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

Although the wines showed differences in their initial phenolic profiles, the evolution trend of the different families of phenolic compounds was similar in the wines from the three grape varieties. {TA} markedly decreased during ageing in bottle (43\% for Tempranillo, 65\% for Graciano and 66\% for Cabernet Sauvignon), following a first-order kinetic. Calculation of the kinetic parameters revealed that the disappearance rate of {TA} was 2-fold lower for Tempranillo wine than for Graciano and Cabernet Sauvignon wines, which exhibited similar kinetics. This decrease in {TA} (due to the disappearance of monomeric anthocyanins), together with a increase registered in {CAT} and {PRO} (due to the cleavage of proanthocyanidins and their structural tranformations), was consistent with a decrease in {LPP}, suggesting the occurrence of condensation reactions during ageing in bottle. The evolution trends observed for {TP} and {OD} during ageing in bottle were the results of changes in the different groups of phenolic compounds involved in both determinations. Global phenolic determinations, usually performed in wineries, provided useful information in relation to the evolution of wine polyphenols during ageing in bottle. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This study shows an increase in the concentration of the phenols at the beginning of alcoholic fermentation, as well as a stabilization and slight increase in gallic acid and a slight decrease in resveratrol during the oak barrel ageing step. {CONCLUSION}: This study demonstrates the potential of {NMR} as a process analytical technology ({PAT}) tool in the wine industry, by monitoring amino acids, organic acids and three polyphenols – gallic acid, catechin and resveratrol – during the winemaking process.

The wines were sealed with six types of stoppers, including natural cork, agglomerated cork, technical cork, and three types of polymer synthetic plugs, to provide different oxygen environments during wine development. Results showed that volatile compounds in all of the wine samples exhibited three evolution trends during the bottle-aging process. Most of the volatiles followed the second evolution trend in which their concentration increased within the first 3–9 months of bottle aging, and subsequently declined. The wines bottle-aged within 9 months possessed obvious aroma characteristics, which resulted from the abundant volatile compounds in this period, in particular, the presence of esters and alcohols. The 15-month bottle-aged wines showed the highest sensory quality evolution, suggesting that this might be related to a good balance of various aroma attributes. Partial least squares regression analysis revealed that wine aroma could develop toward good perception with the increase in ethyl octanoate, 1-octen-3-ol, and ethyl dodecanoate. However, the increase in (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, 2-methoxy-phenol, decanal, isobutyric acid, octanoic acid, and isoamyl acetate resulted in a negative sensory feature of wine aroma. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this study, the urinary metabolomics approach using liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry ({LC}-{TOF}/{MS}) was developed to assess the toxicity-attenuation effects and corresponding mechanisms of {HI} on {CDDP}-exposed rats.

The effect of bottle closures with increased oxygen ingress had a similar trend. Increased acetaldehyde levels and oxygen ingress also yielded higher levels of the heterocyclic acetals from glycerol.

	abstract = {Wine is one of the most consumed beverages around the world. It is composed of alcohols, sugars, acids, minerals, proteins and other compounds, such as organic acids and volatile and phenolic compounds (also called polyphenols). Polyphenols have been shown to be highly related to both (i) wine quality (color, flavor, and taste) and (ii) health-promoting properties (antioxidant and cardioprotective among others). Polyphenols can be grouped into two big families: (i) Flavonoids, including anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavanols, hydrolysable and condensed tannins, flavanones, flavones and chalcones; and (ii) Non-flavonoids, including hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, stilbenes, tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol. Each group affects in some way the different properties of wine to a greater or a lesser extent. For that reason, the phenolic composition can be managed to obtain singular wines with specific, desirable characteristics. The current review presents a summary of the ways in which the phenolic composition of wine can be modulated, including (a) invariable factors such as variety, field management or climatic conditions; (b) pre-fermentative strategies such as maceration, thermovinification and pulsed electric field; (c) fermentative strategies such as the use of different yeasts and bacteria; and (d) post-fermentative strategies such as maceration, fining agents and aging. Finally, the different extraction methods and analytical techniques used for polyphenol detection and quantification have been also reviewed. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Malbec is the flagship variety of Argentina mainly due to its high oenological value and plasticity to obtain different wine styles. During bottled aging, the chemical and organoleptic composition of wines is subject to changes depending on the aging conditions (closure, oxygen level, temperature, time). However, the combined effect of these factors on chemical composition and organoleptic characteristics of Malbec wines has not been studied yet. Wines were bottled with screw cap and natural cork and were kept in chambers at 15 °C and 25 °C for 2 years. Sampling was performed at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months. Concentrations of free sulfur dioxide, dissolved oxygen, anthocyanins, tannins, esters, volatile phenols, organic acids, and color saturation decreased during the storage process. While, the formation of polymeric pigments, the color attributes (lightness and hue) and the levels of alcohols, norisoprenoids, furanoids and terpenoids increased. At 24 months, Malbec wines were organoleptically different. Wines kept at 15 °C were associated with high sensory perceptions in color intensity and violet tint, those presented a positive correlation with free sulfur dioxide, tannins, and anthocyanins levels. On the contrary, wines aged at 25 °C were linked with high sensory perceptions of dried vegetative and dried fruit aromas. These descriptors were positively correlated with norisoprenoids, furanoids, and terpenoids. In general, the chemical composition and organoleptic attributes of bottled Malbec wines (Mendoza, Argentina) were stable respect closure type employed, but highly sensitive to the combined effect of time and storage temperature. This finding is key to making decisions about the wine style searched, and costs (e.g. refrigeration) involved in the conservation period until consumption. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

During fermentation, yeasts produce enzymes that affect the skin’s phenolic compounds extraction and synthesize some of the most important wine volatile compounds. Generally, selected yeasts of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) strains are inoculated, which are responsible for carrying out the wine fermentation, enhancing and highlighting its sensory characteristics and contributing to help achieve the wine typicity, according to the winemaker’s criteria. After fermentation, all wines require aging in a bottle to modulate their composition and stability over time. Thus, four different Sc strains (Sc1–Sc4) were inoculated into tanks with Tempranillo grapes to carry out, in duplicate, their fermentation and subsequent aging in bottles (9 months), comparing the aromatic and phenolic composition between them. Results showed differences in the fermentation process (kinetic, ethanol yield), {CI}, {TPI} and content of alcohols, esters, anthocyanins, flavonols and flavanols in wines from the different Sc strains studied. Moreover, in the content in wines of most groups of aromas and phenols, except for total acetate esters and flavonols, aging in a bottle had more influence than the yeast strain used for fermentation. © 2022 by the authors.

Specific phenolic ageing markers were selected and hemi-synthesized: vitisin B, malvidin-ethyl-catechin, and epicatechin-sulfonate. A targeted quantification method of these markers was then developed and validated by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography - triple quadrupole mass spectrometry ({UHPLC}-{QqQ}-{MS}) operating in {MRM} (Multiple Reaction Monitoring). Results showed a significant decline in native grape polyphenol levels (anthocyanins, flavanols) as ageing progresses while pyranoanthocyanins, ethyl-linked pigments, and flavanol-sulfonates content increased. The cork oxygen transfer rate emerged as a pivotal factor and had significant effects on polyphenolic concentration evolution but had no significant impact on flavanol-sulfonate formation. These results provide valuable insights into the chemical evolution ongoing during wine ageing, accentuating the pivotal role of cork stopper selection in preserving wine quality over time. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Wine is perhaps the most ancient and popular alcoholic beverage worldwide. Winemaking practices involve careful vineyard management alongside controlled alcoholic fermentation and potential aging of the wine in barrels. Afterwards, the wine is placed in bottles and stored or distributed in retail. Yet, it is considered that wine achieves its optimum properties after a certain storage time in the bottle. The main outcome of bottle storage is a decrease of astringency and bitterness, improvement of aroma and a lighter and more stable color. This is due to a series of complex chemical changes of its components revolving around the minimized and controlled passage of oxygen into the bottle. For this matter, antioxidants like sulfur oxide are added to avoid excessive oxidation and consequent degradation of the wine. In the same sense, bottles must be closed with appropriate stoppers and stored in adequate, stable conditions, as the wine may develop unappealing color, aromas and flavors otherwise. In this review, features of bottle aging, relevance of stoppers, involved chemical reactions and storage conditions affecting wine quality will be addressed. © 2021 by the authors.

Natural wines are obtained using exclusively native vines, indigenous yeasts, absence of additives, irregular temperature control during fermentation, and smaller quantities of sulfites even compared to organic wines. In this work, natural wines were obtained from Fiano grape, a historical cultivar of Irpinia (Campania, Italy). The main objective of this study was to compare the chemical and sensory characteristics of natural wines produced using different vessels (10 {HL}): Test A: stainless steel; Test B: earthenware amphora; Test C: mulberry wood barrel; and Test D: cherry wood barrel without the use of starter yeasts and chemical additives, including sulfites. Our results show a greater concentration of higher alcohols and esters in wines obtained in amphora and wooden barrels. The results of this work reveal that the type of container influences the composition of wine to an important extent. In addition, the Fiano wines obtained have a distinctive sensory profile also due to the ancestral winemaking process used, which did not involve the use of starter yeasts or technological and chemical adjuvants. © 2023 by the authors.},

Speciﬁcally, it focuses on the measurement of aqueous samples with analyte concentrations ranging from 30 {mM} to 1.7 M and electrical conductivity of up to 84 {mS} {cmÀ}1 using a 43 {MHz} instrument. It is demonstrated that measurements using the {PULCON} method cannot achieve an average error in quantiﬁcation of {\textless}4\% with the benchtop {NMR} tested here unless the standard and analyte are very similar. Our analysis indicates that this comparatively large error arises from the ﬁxed tuning and matching of the benchtop spectrometer. We conﬁrm that for moderately dilute samples (less than 0:2 M), the integral area of the solvent peak is suitable for use as an internal standard to mitigate this error. Furthermore, a round robin study demonstrates that the second major source of uncertainty in these measurements arises from the manual processing of the spectra by different analysts. Here we propose heuristics for manual baseline and phase correction to reduce this analyst-dependent error to about 3 \%. We also demonstrate that semi-automated quantiﬁcation using {qGSD} is able to achieve similar accuracy of integration, but with reduced sensitivity to the processing of the operator.},

	abstract = {In this study, a reliable method was established for the absolute quantification of metabolite concentrations in human seminal plasma using {ERETIC}2, a quantification tool developed by Bruker based on the {PULCON} prin­ ciple. The performance of the {ERETIC}2 was examined using an {AVANCE} {III} {HD} {NMR} spectrometer (600 {MHz}) equipped with a triple inverse 1.7 mm {TXI} probe in terms of some experimental parameters that may affect the accuracy and precision of the quantitative results. Then, the accuracy, precision, and repeatibility of {ERETIC}2 were determined using L-asparagine solutions at different concentrations. And it was evaluated by comparing it with the classical internal standard ({IS}) quantification method. The relative standard deviation ({RSD}) values for {ERETIC}2 were calculated in the range of 0.55–1.90\% and the minimum recovery value was 99.9\%, while the {RSD} values for the {IS} method were calculated in the range of 0.88–5.83\% and recovery value was minimum 91.0\%. Besides, the {RSD} values of the inter-day precisions for the {ERETIC}2 and {IS} methods were obtained to be in the range of 1.25 − 3.03\% and 0.97 − 3.46\%, respectively. Finally, the concentration values of seminal plasma metabolites were determined using different pulse programs with both methods for samples obtained from normozoospermic control and azoospermic patient groups. The results proved that this quantification method developed using {NMR} spectroscopy is easy to use in complex sample systems such as biological fluids and is a good alternative to the classical internal standard method in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. In addition, the improvement of the spectral resolution and sensitivity with the microcoil probe technology and the possibility of analyzing with minimum sample quantities has contributed positively to the results of this method.},

	abstract = {Methanol, a hepato- and neurotoxic compound, is present in apple-based beverages as a by-product of the enzymatic degradation of pectin. Stable isotope dilution assay ({SIDA}) employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ({GC}–{MS}) is the state-of-the-art method for methanol determination in beverages. Despite higher initial investment costs, quantitative 1H {NMR} spectroscopy ({qNMR}) is a simpler and faster analytical technique to quantify numerous analytes in liquid foods. Beyond targeted analyses, {qNMR} spectral fingerprints in the product might be used for non-targeted analytical goals, such as adulteration and contamination detections. Here, an existing 1H-{qNMR} method used for wine profiling was optimised for methanol quantification in apple-based products, including cross-validation against a {SIDA}-{HS}-{GC}–{MS} method and reference values from interlabor­ atory trials. The optimisation involved a pivotally important estimation of a correction factor by an external calibration approach, making {qNMR} results comparable to {SIDA}-{HS}-{GC}–{MS}. The optimised {qNMR} method is suggested to be an alternative for methanol quantification in beverages.},

	abstract = {An integrated targeted-untargeted 1H and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ({NMR}) analysis was applied to determine the impact of roasting on coﬀee lipids. For targeted analysis, both an internal standard ({IS}) method, as well as the {ERETIC}2 tool based on {PULCON} (Pulse Length-based Concentration determination), were used for quantitation. {PULCON} allows for quantitative analysis without sample contamination with an {IS} and was found to be in very good agreement with the traditional {IS} approach as indicated by a systematic Bland-Altman comparison study. For the untargeted analysis, {NMR} was coupled with multivariate statistical analysis ({MVSA}), namely Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis ({HCA}), and Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis ({OPLS}-{DA}). 13C {NMR} spectra were acquired using a z-stored spin-echo sequence to achieve higher spectral quality, which is important for both targeted and untargeted analysis. Results showed that roasting has a clear eﬀect on coﬀee lipids, with diterpenes, oxidation/hydrolysis products and unsaturated fatty acid chains being the most signiﬁcant markers. In addition, the application of {MRI} indicated important morphological alterations in bean structure and lipid migration from the endosperm to the surface of the coﬀee bean.},
